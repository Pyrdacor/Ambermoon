Zero palette (64 zero bytes)

Then 3 sections:
- dword actionListOffset (into this hunk)
- dword imageOffset (into other hunk)
(This is basically a change picture action)
This repeats until a null ptr for the actionListOffset
Then the next section starts

After the 3rd section there is:

80 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 FF

Most likely some default action like:
- 128 scroll
- X = 0
- Not large
- No text (only terminating 0)

Twice this action and then a wait for click.
Such actions are basically just scrolls without text.



At the actionListOffsets there are the text actions:

- byte scrollOffset (if 0xff it is the end of the click group and means wait for click)
- byte textX
- byte largeText (0 = no, 1 = true)
- byte[x] null terminated text


At the end of the hunk it is filled with zeros to a full long offset!
