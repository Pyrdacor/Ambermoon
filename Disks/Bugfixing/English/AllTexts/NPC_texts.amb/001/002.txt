"I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY AND ASSIGN YOU A QUEST."^ AS YOU STEP CLOSER TO THE BED TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU SEE HOW HIS FACE DISTORTS IN PAIN AND ABOVE HIS HEAD YOU FEEL YOU SEE THE SHADOW OF BALA.^ "WHEN I WAS JUST YOUR AGE, I HAD A DIFFICULT LIFE. YOUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS HAD JUST BEEN KILLED BY MARAUDING ORCS. A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL I DECIDED TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE. I WAS GIVEN MY FIRST TASK BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF TWINLAKE WHO HAD A SMALL PROBLEM WITH HIS DRAINS. WHEN THE TASK WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY KARWAIN, THE LORD CHANCELLOR, TOLD ME THAT SHANDRA, THE GREY MAGICIAN, HAD SOMETHING HE NEEDED TO DO AND WAS LOOKING FOR A GROUP OF BRAVE PEOPLE.^ THAT VERY EVENING I WENT TO SHANDRA. WHAT THEN HAPPENED IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE CERTAINLY ALREADY HEARD IN THE STORIES AND SONGS OF THE BARDS. BUT THAT I WAS THE GREAT HERO IS SOMETHING I NEVER TOLD YOU BECAUSE I FEEL ONE SHOULD NOT BRAG ABOUT ONE'S DEEDS.^ THE REASON I AM TELLING YOU THIS NOW IS BECAUSE SHANDRA APPEARED TO ME LAST NIGHT IN MY FEVER. THAT MISTY BEING TOLD ME THAT A DARK POWER IS AGAIN SPREADING OVER THE LAND AND INTENDS TO DESTROY LYRAMION."^ HE COLLAPSES IN A FIT OF COUGHING. THEN HE CONTINUES:^ "OH, AS IF THE CATASTROPHE WITH THE THIRD MOON HAD NOT BROUGHT ENOUGH SUFFERING AND PAIN TO LYRAMION! YOUR BELOVED PARENTS DIED IN THAT DREADFUL DISASTER. I ALONE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE SEA OF FIRE. MY BELOVED TWINLAKE WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE AND FLOOD.^ BUT I MUST TRY TO KEEP TO THE POINT BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE NOT MUCH TIME LEFT. SO I WILL HURRY TO TELL YOU THE REST.^ SO, SHANDRA SAID THAT THE GOOD SIDE OF OUR FAMILY IS OUR STRENGTH AND HE CHOSE YOU TO SAVE LYRAMION AGAIN. YOU SHOULD GET STARTED AND GO TO NEWLAKE TO TALK TO HIM.^ THE STRANGE THING IS JUST THAT SHANDRA DIED MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO! WHEN I WAS FLEEING FROM TWINLAKE I SAW HOW HE TELEPORTED A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO SAFETY. THEN HE COLLAPSED, TOTALLY EXHAUSTED.^ EITHER HE WAS KILLED BY THE ENORMOUS EFFORT HE MADE OR BY THE MOON WHEN IT HURTLED DOWN ONTO TWINLAKE A SHORT TIME LATER. BUT APPARENTLY EVEN DEATH DOES NOT STOP HIS INFLUENCE.^ I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NO NORMAL DREAM AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS HAPPENING. FOR THIS REASON I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE ON THIS QUEST AND FIND SHANDRA. GO TO NEWLAKE AND TRY TO CONTACT HIM THERE.^ YOU SHOULD MAKE PREPARATIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE! NOTE THE WORD >WINE< AND GO DOWN INTO THE CELLAR. YOU NEED THE WORD TO GET PAST THE OLD STONE HEAD IN ORDER TO ENTER THE WINE CELLAR. IN THE WINE CELLAR IS A SWITCH WHICH OPENS THE PASSAGEWAY TO THE CAVE IN THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. I LEFT MY OLD ARMOUR IN THE DEPTHS OF THIS CAVE. YOU CAN USE EVERYTHING YOU FIND THERE FOR YOUR QUEST. BUT YOU SHOULD BRING ME THE SMALL PIECE OF AMBER WHICH SHANDRA GAVE ME WITH THE WORDS >THE ETERNAL CONNECTION<!^ NOW GO AND HURRY FOR I SEE BALA'S REALMS CLEARLY BEFORE ME AND CANNOT WAIT TOO LONG!^ OH YES, TAKE A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN WITH YOU. WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAVE MADE A NEST IN THE CAVE BY NOW!"
