THE PAIN-RIDDEN EYES OF YOUR GRANDFATHER GLANCE OVER THE SHIMMERING AMBER STONE IN YOUR HAND. IN A QUIET VOICE HE SAYS:^ "I WAS GIVEN THIS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO BY SHANDRA. I NEVER FOUND WHAT ITS PURPOSE IS BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS FEEL IT HAS A MAGIC AURA. I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT SHANDRA'S WORDS: >THE ETERNAL CONNECTION<.^ PERHAPS YOU MUST USE THE STONE SOMEWHERE IN ORDER TO MAKE CONTACT WITH SHANDRA."
