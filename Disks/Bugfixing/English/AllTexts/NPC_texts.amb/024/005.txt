"YES, I WAS ONCE EMPLOYED IN DONNER'S MINE, BUT NOW, NOW THEY HAVE ALL GONE, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING THERE ALONE. I HID THE KEY ON THE ISLAND IN FRONT OF THE MINE. YOU ONLY NEED TO STICK THIS ROD IN THE GROUND ON THE ISLAND IN FRONT OF THE HILL."^ WITH THESE WORDS HE PRODUCES A WOODEN ROD FROM HIS APRON. SUDDENLY HE SEEMS TO HEAR A NOISE FROM ABOVE BECAUSE HIS HEAD JERKS UP AND HIS EYES LONGINGLY SEARCH THE SKY. HE APPEARS NOT TO HAVE NOTICED THAT HE DROPPED THE ROD.
