~INK 30~ FERRIN LOOKS AT YOU BLACKLY AND FINALLY TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND CONTINUES:^ ~INK 31~ "WELL, OKAY! I SHOULD NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY. PERHAPS YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.^ FOUR DAYS AGO MY LITTLE DAUGHTER DISAPPEARED FROM THE STORAGE CELLAR AT MY OWN HOME. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO FETCH SOMETHING, AS SO OFTEN. SHE NEVER RETURNED, SIMPLY DISAPPEARED WITHOUT TRACE. ALL OUR SEARCHING WAS IN VAIN. WE FOUND TRACKS LEFT BY FEET WITH CLAWS BUT NONE OF THE DAMNED BEASTS WERE TO BE SEEN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND HOPE IS DYING DAY BY DAY."^ ~INK 30~ HE CLOSES HIS EYES AND JUST WHISPERS:^ ~INK 31~ "I..., I SENT HER DOWN THERE MYSELF."^ ~INK 30~ HE HANDS YOU A KEY WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD.
