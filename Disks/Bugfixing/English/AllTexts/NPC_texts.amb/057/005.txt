THAT STUBBORN CHAP WOULD NEVER ..."^ ~INK 30~ DESPITE THESE WORDS DORINA ACCEPTS THE ENVELOPE. SHE TRIES TO LOOK CALM AND UNCONCERNED BUT YOU SEE HER HANDS TREMBLE SLIGHTLY AS SHE BREAKS THE SEAL. SHE PULLS OUT THE PARCHMENT AND BEGINS TO READ:^ ~INK 31~ "IT REALLY IS FROM HIM ... TEN YEARS AGO ... OH, GOD!"^ ~INK 30~ WHILE DORINA IS IMMERSED IN THE LETTER, MANY DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS CROSS HER FACE. TEARS STREAM DOWN HER CHEEKS BUT ARE FINALLY REPLACED BY A SMILE. SHE TRIES TO COLLECT HERSELF AND TURNS TO YOU:^ ~INK 31~ "THANK YOU FOR THIS MESSAGE, FRIENDS, OH THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! YOU CANNOT BELIEVE HOW SUCH A SIMPLE LITTLE LETTER CAN MEAN SO MUCH. BUT I LIVED AT KIRE'S SIDE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE ADMITS TO HAVING MADE A MISTAKE, SHOWING REGRET AND REMORSE. YES, HE ASKS MY FORGIVENESS, JUST IMAGINE!^ WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM? WELL, IT IS EASY TO FIND OUT. LET US GO!"^ ~INK 30~ THIS TIME IT IS YOU WHO ARE ASTONISHED! AS QUICK AS LIGHTNING DORINA PACKS A FEW BELONGINGS AND THEN STANDS LOOKING AT YOU WITH A FIRM EXPRESSION IN HER EYES.^ YOU COLLECT YOUR THINGS AND MAKE READY FOR YOUR DEPARTURE FOR DORE KIREDON.
