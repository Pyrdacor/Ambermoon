"UH, OH? VISITORS? CUSTOMERS? WELCOME TO MY TOWER! IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU REACHED ME! YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT AT THE MOMENT I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH A JEALOUS MAGICIAN BY THE NAME OF DREK."^ ~LEAD~ STARTS TO SPEAK AND SAYS:^ "DEAR LEBAB, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ANY MORE! DREK IS DEAD, AND MOST OF HIS GARGOYLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED."^ LEBAB LOOKS AT YOU FOR A MOMENT IN AN IRRITATED MANNER, BUT APPEARS TO HAVE ACCEPTED THESE FACTS, FOR HE DOES NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS BUT JUST SAYS:^ "OH YES, REALLY, VERY INTERESTING! THEN I CAN CLEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE TELEPORTER ON THE FIRST FLOOR AGAIN AND SWITCH OFF THE STONE GOLEMS."
