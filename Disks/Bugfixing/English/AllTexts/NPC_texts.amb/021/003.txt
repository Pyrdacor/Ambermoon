"I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING MAGICS WORD FOR MANY YEARS. I'VE FOUND TWO ALREADY BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ONLY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.^ THE FIRST ONE WAS >SCHNISM<. WHEN YOU USE IT, NOTHING HAPPENS EXCEPT FOR A DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKING WORDS WHICH DON'T MAKE SENSE.^ APPARENTLY >TEMPUS FUGIT< MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE POWERFUL. IF AFTER SAYING THAT, YOU ALSO CALL >HELP<, APPARENTLY YOU HAVE ALMOST UNLIMITED POWERS.^ IT IS SAID THAT MAGIC WORDS WHICH GIVE YOU POWER ALSO EXIST IN OUR TIME. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM. PERHAPS YOU WILL HAVE MORE LUCK THAN I.^ INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MYSTIC MAGIC SPELLS, PLEASE VISIT MY LIBRARY."
