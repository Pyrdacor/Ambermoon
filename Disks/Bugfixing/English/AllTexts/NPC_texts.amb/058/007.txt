"YOU SEEM WELL INFORMED ABOUT MY FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES. DORINA IS MY MOTHER. ONLY FOR HER DO I SOMETIMES REGRET THE DISAGREEMENT WITH MY FATHER. SHE SUFFERED UNDER KIRE'S INSENSITIVITY. IT WAS QUITE RIGHT OF HER TO TURN HER BACK."^ ~INK 30~ KETNAR WILL NOT SPEAK ANY MORE ABOUT DORINA BUT YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HIS MOTHER.
