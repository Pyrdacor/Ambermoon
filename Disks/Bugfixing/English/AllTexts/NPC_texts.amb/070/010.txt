"BLADUS RETURNED ON THE WINGS OF A DRAGON TO HIS HOME TOWN, PORT PYLON. I AM AMAZED AT HIS PERSISTENCE, FOR AFTER OUR CELEBRATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE PEOPLES IN PEGANA HE SPENT THREE MORE DAYS AS THE CENTREPOINT OF A PARTY. BUT SINCE THEN HE HAS BECOME RESTLESS AGAIN. HE VISITED ME MORE THAN A WEEK AGO WHEN HE WAS PASSING THROUGH. HE IS LOOKING FOR MORE ADVENTURES AGAIN. AS IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXCITEMENT ALREADY!"
