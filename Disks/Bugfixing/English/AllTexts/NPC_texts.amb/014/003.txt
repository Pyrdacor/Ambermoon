"A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY STOLE ONE OF OUR GOLDEN WINE GOBLETS. I HEARD A NOISE AT NIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND GOT UP. AS I OPENED THE DOOR TO THE DINING ROOM, I JUST SAW A GREEN FIGURE WITH LONG WINGS FLYING OFF THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW. YES, YES, IT WAS FLYING. I DID NOT WANT TO BELIEVE MY EYES, BUT THAT WAS WHAT I SAW.^ THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINE GOBLETS WAS MISSING. I MUST TELL YOU WE HAD HAD THEM SINCE OUR WEDDING AND WERE VERY ATTACHED TO THEM.^ A FEW DAYS LATER THE SECOND ONE WAS ALSO STOLEN. THIS TIME MY HUSBAND HEARD THE THIEF. HE GOT UP QUIETLY AND WAS ABLE TO CHALLENGE HIM. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE TWO OF THEM. THE OTHER ONE ATTACKED MY HUSBAND FROM BEHIND AND BRUISED HIM BADLY.^ MY HUSBAND NOW NATURALLY BELIEVES THAT THE FIRST WINE GOBLET MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN STOLEN BY THESE BANDITS. HE SAYS THEY WERE DISTURBED ON THE FIRST OCCASION WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS, AND SIMPLY CAME BACK A FEW DAYS LATER. HE BELIEVES THE GREEN FIGURE I SAW WAS SIMPLY A WOMAN'S IMAGINATION AT PLAY. BUT WHATEVER MY BELOVED HUSBAND SAYS, I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A WINGED BEING THAT STOLE THE FIRST WINE GOBLET."
