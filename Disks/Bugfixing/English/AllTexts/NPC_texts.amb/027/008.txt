"XENOBIL IS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE TYPES OF WOOD ANYWHERE IN LYRAMION, MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS SAID TO HAVE GREAT MAGIC POWERS. I CANNOT CHECK THAT MYSELF, BUT MAGICIANS TREASURE THE WOOD VERY HIGHLY.^ UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ONLY A FEW XENOBIL TREES AND THEY GROW UNUSUALLY SLOWLY, SO IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SATISFY THE DEMAND FOR THAT TYPE OF WOOD."
