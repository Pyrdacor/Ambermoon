"SHORTLY AFTER KAY DISAPPEARED, I FOUND A DEAD WILD ANIMAL. JUDGING BY THE TRACKS IT MUST HAVE BEEN DRAGGED OFF BY A TERRIBLE MONSTER. BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND IT. I EXPECT IT IS HIDING IN THE CAVE AT THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND. IF YOU GO NEAR THE CAVE, BE VERY CAREFUL.^ IF YOU ACTUALLY MEET THE MONSTER, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD IMPROVE YOUR ARMOUR A LITTLE. HERE IS THE KEY TO MY WEAPONS CUPBOARD. TAKE WHATEVER YOU FEEL MAY BE USEFUL."
