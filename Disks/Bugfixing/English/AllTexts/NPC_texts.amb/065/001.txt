"YOU HAVE MADE US THE HAPPIEST DWARFS ON THE MOON, FRIENDS! WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY, WHAT STRANGE ABILITIES ARE SLUMBERING IN MY DAUGHTER!^ BUT LET ME GIVE YOU SOMETHING MORE SOLID BY WAY OF THANKS."^ ~INK 30~ HE PULLS OUT AN ARTISTICALLY WORKED BOW. IT IS MADE OF A DARK WOOD AND A STRANGE METAL WHICH SHIMMERS IN EVERY COLOUR.^ ~INK 31~ "I MADE THIS LITTLE TREASURE A SHORT TIME AGO FROM THE BEST WOOD AND THE LAST REMAINS OF LUMIDRA. THIS METAL WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC BY THE FAMOUS ANCESTORS OF MY FAMILY. THE BOW IS LIGHT IN WEIGHT, SO THAT ANYONE CAN USE IT, AND THE BEST THING IS, IT DOES NOT NEED A BOLT!"^ ~INK 30~ WITH THESE WORDS HE HANDS THE WEAPON TO ~LEAD~. IT IS SURPRISINGLY LIGHT AND SITS WONDERFULLY SNUGLY IN HIS HAND.
