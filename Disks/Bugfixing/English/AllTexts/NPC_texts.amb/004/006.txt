AS YOU ASK HIM ABOUT THE BROTHERHOOD, THE YOUNG MAN'S EYES SUDDENLY WIDEN AND HE SAYS:^ "YES, THE BROTHERHOOD. EVER SINCE I HEARD OF IT, I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO REACH THE AGE WHERE I CAN BECOME A MEMBER. THE BROTHERHOOD HAS TAKEN ON THE TASK OF CASTING SPELLS ON THE COFFIN OF TARBOS ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT TO PREVENT HIM FROM SPREADING HIS EVIL DARK POWER OVER LYRAMION AGAIN. FOR THIS PURPOSE THE MEMBERS HAVE BUILT A HUGE TEMPLE ON THE RED EYE OF TARBOS AND SPEND THEIR LIFE THERE KEEPING THE EVIL AWAY FROM OUR WORLD.^ IT IS ONLY THANKS TO THE BROTHERHOOD THAT DREADFUL LORD TARBOS DID NOT REAPPEAR FOR THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS. SO I WILL GO TO NEWLAKE AND TRY TO BECOME A MEMBER."
