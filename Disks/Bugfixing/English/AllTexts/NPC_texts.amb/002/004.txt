"SO, YOU NEED SOMETHING TO FIGHT THE SWAMP FEVER. VERY SIMPLE, BUT YOU MUST FIRST DO THREE THINGS.^ FIRST YOU MUST GO TO THE TOWER OF THE ALCHEMIST AND OBTAIN AN EMPTY PHIAL. TO DO THIS, YOU MUST GO TO THE NORTH WEST THROUGH THE DESERT AND THEN FOLLOW THE RIVER TO THE WEST. YOU WILL REACH THE TOWER A SHORT TIME LATER. IF ANYONE AT THE TOWER ASKS WHO HAS SENT YOU, SIMPLY GIVE THEM MY NAME.^ THEN GO TO THE SWAMP TO THE EAST OF THE TOWER OF THE ALCHEMIST. YOU MUST PLUCK A SWAMP LILY.^ AND FINALLY YOU MUST FIND THE SPRING OF LIFE. THIS IS LOCATED ON A HIGH PLATEAU IN THE CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST. SIMPLY GO IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION PAST THE CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS UNTIL YOU FIND A PASS LEADING TO THE EAST. GO THROUGH IT AND YOU WILL REACH THE BANK OF A RIVER. THERE YOU WILL FIND A DOOR WHOSE KEY IS THIS. BUT BE WARNED, THE GUARDS IN THE CAVE OF LIFE WILL ONLY ALLOW YOU TO REACH THE SPRING OF LIFE IF YOU ARE WORTHY AND CAN WITHSTAND THEIR SEVERE TESTS. AT THE SPRING YOU WILL THEN FILL THE PHIAL.^ BRING IT TO ME. I WILL THEN BE ABLE TO BREW AN ANTIDOTE TO THE SWAMP FEVER FOR YOU."
