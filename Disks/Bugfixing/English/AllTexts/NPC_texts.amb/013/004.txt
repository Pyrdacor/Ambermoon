"I HAVE HEARD THAT SILVERHAND IS THE LEADER OF THE STRANGE BANDITS. THE NAME WAS GIVEN TO HIM BECAUSE OF HIS ARTIFICIAL LEFT HAND. IT IS SAID THAT HE WAS ONCE WALKING OVER THE MARKETPLACE IN SPANNENBERG WHEN A GUST OF WIND LIFTED HIS CLOAK. AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF THE MARKET WOMEN SAW THAT HIS LEFT HAND WAS MADE OF PURE SILVER. SINCE THEN HIS ONLY NAME IS SILVERHAND. WHAT HIS REAL NAME IS, NO-ONE KNOWS, I BELIEVE."
