"MY HUSBAND FEELS I DREAMED THE WHOLE THING BUT AS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE STORY, I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT:^ A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT SO I GOT UP AND LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE TWO MOONS. SOME TIME LATER I SUDDENLY SAW A STRANGE APPARITION. SEVERAL UNUSUAL BEINGS CAME FLYING TOWARDS THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE ANGELS BUT WHEN THEY CAME QUITE CLOSE I COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE WOMEN. THE STRANGE THING ABOUT THEM, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THEIR SKIN WAS BLUE AND GREEN AND THEY HAD LARGE SHIMMERING WINGS.^ ALTHOUGH I PERSONALLY LOCKED THE FRONT DOOR THAT EVENING, A FEW MOMENTS LATER, THEY WERE SIMPLY STANDING IN THE ENTRANCE HALL. I HID AND WATCHED THEM. THEY BEHAVED LIKE SMALL CHILDREN, THEY LAUGHED QUIETLY AND LOOKED AT EVERYTHING WITH GREAT INTEREST. ABOVE ALL, THEY SEEMED TO BE FASCINATED WITH THINGS THAT GLISTENED OR SHONE. I SAW THEM TAKE SEVERAL SILVER SPOONS FROM THE DINING ROOM. THEN, IN THE CONFERENCE CHAMBER THEY FOUND MY HUSBAND'S CHAIN OF OFFICE AND ONE OF THE GREEN-SKINNED BEINGS HID IT AWAY. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AGAIN.^ I QUICKLY PUT A COAT ON AND FOLLOWED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD, TO THE ENTRANCE OF A CAVE TO THE WEST OF HERE, CLOSE TO WHERE THE POND LIES AT THE FOOT OF THE SMALL VOLCANO. IF THEY HAD FLOWN DIRECTLY THERE I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM THAT FAR BUT, AS I SAID, THEY BEHAVED LIKE CHILDREN, EVEN WHILE THEY WERE FLYING. WHEN THEY LANDED, ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF A HOLE IN A TREE NEXT TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE, JUST LIKE YOU MIGHT TAKE THE KEY TO YOUR HOUSE OUT FROM UNDER A PLANT POT.^ BUT I DID NOT FOLLOW THEM INTO THE CAVE BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. I RETURNED TO SPANNENBERG.^ IN THE MORNING I TOLD MY HUSBAND EVERYTHING BUT HE THOUGHT I ONLY DREAMED IT AND THAT THE CHAIN OF OFFICE HAD BEEN STOLEN BY THE STRANGE BANDITS."
