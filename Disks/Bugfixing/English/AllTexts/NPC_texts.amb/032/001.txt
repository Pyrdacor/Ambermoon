"MY FRIENDS ... - I HOPE I CAN CALL YOU FRIENDS?! FORGIVE ME, FOR IT WAS I WHO TELEPORTED YOU OUT OF THE AIRSHIP HANGAR. BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, PLEASE LISTEN, FOR I AM DYING AND HAVE MUCH TO TELL YOU!^ THE FIRST THING YOU MUST KNOW IS THAT OUR SITUATION HAS BEEN AS IT IS ON LYRAMION FOR MUCH LONGER THAN YOURS. WE DISCOVERED AT A VERY EARLY STAGE THAT MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER CAN BE VERY POWERFUL. BUT THE SUCCESS WE ACHIEVED MADE US IRRESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY WE MISUSED WATER AND FINALLY RESULTED IN OUR DOWNFALL. OUR WORLD WAS ALWAYS VERY DRY BUT IT IS OUR OWN FAULT THAT IT BECAME AS BAD AS YOU NOW SEE. WE WASTED THE WATER ALTHOUGH IT WAS SO SCARCE AND PRECIOUS. MY CONDITION TODAY IS PROOF THAT THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST MISTAKE.^ IF OUR BODIES DO NOT GET ANY WATER FOR ONE DAY, WE DIE. WE DRY OUT COMPLETELY AND DECOMPOSE INTO JUST DUST AND BONES. NO-ONE CAN HELP ME NOW. EVEN IF I WERE GIVEN WATER, I WOULD STILL DIE.^ THE COMMITTEE OF MORAG, OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER, THEREFORE HAD THE IDEA OF DEVELOPING SOMETHING WHICH WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PLANETS. WE MANAGED IT, AND AFTER A VERY LONG TIME WE FLEW TO THE FOREST MOON. BUT WE ALSO HAD TO RETREAT FROM THERE WHEN MORE AND MORE OF US DIED.^ THE WATER ON THE FOREST MOON CONTAINS A SUBSTANCE WHICH KILLS US SLOWLY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT DANGEROUS TO YOU HUMANS AND THE OTHER BEINGS ON YOUR WORLD. DESPITE ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE WE WERE UNABLE TO PURIFY THE WATER AND SO WE HAD TO WITHDRAW TO MORAG. THEN, A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE WOULD TAKE THE WATER FROM LYRAMION.^ WITH THE HELP OF YOUR DWARFS, APPROXIMATELY TWO DECADES AGO WE BUILT A HUGE MACHINE ON LYRAMION WHICH IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WILL START TO TRANSPORT THE WATER FROM LYARMION TO MORAG, AND THAT WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR YOU.^ RECENTLY I HAVE HAD MORE AND MORE FEELINGS OF GUILT AND A FEW DAYS AGO I PLEADED WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT WE SHOULD DROP THE WHOLE PLAN. INSTEAD I SUGGESTED WE SHOULD MAKE OURSELVES KNOWN TO THE BEINGS ON LYRAMION AND ASK FOR ASYLUM.^ AS YOU SEE, THEY DID NOT SHARE MY VIEWS. NOW YOU ARE THE LAST HOPE FOR LYRAMION. YOU MUST TRY TO DESTROY THE MACHINE. BUT THE ENTRANCE ON LYRAMION IS HIDDEN BEHIND A CRYSTAL WALL WHICH CAN ONLY BE REMOVED BY CERTAIN SOUNDS. TO REACH IT, YOU MUST ENTER THE PALACES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE ON MORAG. EACH OF US POSSESSES A CRYSTAL HARP STRING. YOU MUST COLLECT ALL SEVEN STRINGS AND FIT THEM TO A HARP. THIS HARP IS THEN ABLE TO DESTROY THE CRYSTAL WALL. IT THEN DEPENDS SOLELY ON YOU WHETHER LYRAMION WILL SURVIVE. IF YOU SUCCEED, THE PROBLEM WITH THE WATER CAN PERHAPS BE SETTLED AMICABLY.^ OH, MY TIME IS COMING! I WILL DO THREE THINGS FOR YOU BEFORE I DIE: FIRSTLY I WILL TEACH YOU THE LANGUAGE OF THE MORANIAN. THEN I WILL PUT A SPELL ON YOU SO THAT EVERYONE WILL THINK YOU ARE MORANIAN. HOWEVER, THAT WILL NOT FOOL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND FINALLY I WILL TELEPORT YOU TO MY PALACE. FROM THERE, YOU MUST START YOUR SEARCH FOR THE HARP STRINGS ..."^ YOU SEE HOW S'RIEL RAISES HIS ARMS, EVIDENTLY WITH ONE LAST EFFORT, AND IMMEDIATELY YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT. ONE LAST TIME YOU HEAR HIS VOICE SAYING WEAKLY:^ "BE CAREFUL! IT COULD BE THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SET A TRAP FOR YOU IN MY PALACE ..."
