"WELL, YES, AT THE MOMENT I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS HERE IN SPANNENBERG.^^ THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES ORCS ATTACKING MY FARMERS. THEY SUDDENLY COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST AND PLUNDER THE FIELDS AND THE FARMS.^ IF YOU COULD STOP THEIR ATTACKS AND BRING ME PROOF THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT, I WILL REWARD YOU GENEROUSLY.^ FURTHERMORE, THE TOWN IS PLAGUED BY A GANG OF BANDITS. THE LEADER IS SAID TO BE A MAN CALLED SILVERHAND. ALL THESE YEARS I HAD A GOOD ARRANGEMENT, UMM, I MEAN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUILD OF THIEVES IN SPANNENBERG. THEIR MEMBERS ARE WELL DISCIPLINED, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN RULES, AND THEY ONLY STOLE ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES, SO TO SPEAK. THE CITIZENS IN THE TOWN WERE CERTAINLY ABLE TO PUT UP WITH THEM.^ ALTHOUGH THE MASTERS OF THE GUILD PROMISE ME THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLAGUE AT THIS TIME, I CANNOT QUITE BELIEVE THEM AND THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE ARE NOW RATHER UPSET. PERHAPS YOU CAN SPREAD SOME LIGHT ON THE MATTER."
