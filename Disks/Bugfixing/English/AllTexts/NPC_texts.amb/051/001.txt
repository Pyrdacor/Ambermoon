"OH, I AM NATURALLY NOT THE ONLY ONE IN DOR KIREDON WHO MISSES THE OLD TIMES. BUT WHEN I THINK BACK TO MY MINE AND THE TIMES IN GEMSTONE, I GET VERY ANGRY.^ DO YOU KNOW, ~SELF~, I EVEN MET YOUR GRANDFATHER. CERTAINLY HE TOLD YOU THAT OLD DONNER HELPED HIM TO FIND A PIECE OF THE AMBERSTAR. THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES!^ BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED. HEAVENS, OUR NAIVETY WAS ONLY EXCEEDED BY OUR STUBBORNESS! AND KIRE, OUR GREAT LEADER, WAS THE MOST STUBBORN OF ALL! BUT I SHOULD BE FAIR - HE REALLY DID MAKE THE BEST OF OUR SITUATION. FATE HAS PUNISHED HIM VERY SEVERELY."
