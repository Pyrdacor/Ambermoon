"SHE IS A HEALER, JUST LIKE ME, AND LEADS THE HOUSE OF HEALERS IN BURNVILLE ON THE ISLAND TO THE SOUTH OF US. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE HEARD NOTHING MORE FROM HER FOR WEEKS AND THAT IS WHY I AM VERY WORRIED THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.^ IT WOULD BE NICE OF YOU IF YOU COULD CHECK ON MY DAUGHTER IN BURNVILLE. I WILL GIVE YOU THIS KEY. IT FITS THE CHEST IN MY ROOM. IN THE CHEST YOU WILL FIND A FEW THINGS WHICH COULD BE USEFUL TO YOU ON YOUR JOURNEY. YOU WILL ALSO FIND A KEY IN THE CHEST. YOU CAN USE IT TO OPEN THE SHORT-CUT TO BURNVILLE. IF YOU GO FROM THE QUAY SOUTHWARDS TO THE NEXT ISLAND YOU WILL REACH THE TUNNEL."
