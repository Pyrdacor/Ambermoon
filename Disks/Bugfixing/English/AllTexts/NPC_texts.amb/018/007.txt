"I HAVE LOST MY IRREPLACEABLE MAGIC RING. WITHOUT IT I CAN NEITHER WRITE MAGIC SCROLLS OR PREPARE DRINKS.^ A FEW WEEKS AGO I WAS SEARCHING FOR STRANGE REAGENTS. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF ENTERING THE PARTLY-COLLAPSED CRYPT TO THE EAST OF HERE. I THOUGHT I COULD FIND A FEW STRANGE TYPES OF MUSHROOMS THERE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT CAREFUL ENOUGH. I ACCIDENTALLY WOKE THE UNDEAD AND I LOST MY RING SOMEHOW WHEN I WAS RUNNING AWAY.^ YOU LOOK LIKE MEN WHO COULD FIND IT, AM I RIGHT? COME ON, SAY YES - HERE IS THE KEY TO THE CRYPT."
