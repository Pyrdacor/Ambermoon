"SO, YOU NEED TOOLS? WELL, I AM NOT AN IRONMONGER BUT PERHAPS WE CAN DO BUSINESS.^ A FEW DAYS AGO SILVERHAND AND HIS BANDITS ROBBED MY BUSINESS HERE. THE MAIN THING I AM SORRY ABOUT IS THAT THEY TOOK MY FOUR GOLDEN HORSE SHOES. IF YOU CAN RETURN ALL FOUR OF THEM TO ME, I WILL BE PLEASED TO GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS."
