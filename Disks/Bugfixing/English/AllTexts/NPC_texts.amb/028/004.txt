"YES, WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED AT THE MOMENT. SOME MONTHS AGO SANSRI, THE SNAKE GODDESS, CAME TO ILLIEN. AT FIRST SHE WAS QUITE NORMAL AND I INVITED HER TO A BANQUET AT THE PALACE. DURING THE BANQUET SHE ASKED ME TO GIVE HER A YOUNG EAGLE. NATURALLY I REFUSED AND SHE STORMED OUT OF THE PALACE IN RAGE!^ A FEW DAYS LATER SHE TOOK HER FEARSOME REVENGE: SHE ATTACKED THE EYRIE OF THE EAGLES. FIRST SHE TURNED THE GUARDS TO STONE AND THEN THE EAGLES THEMSELVES. THE NEXT DAY A MESSAGE ARRIVED FROM HER. SHE WARNED THAT IF SHE COULD NOT HAVE ANY OF THE EAGLES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY EITHER.^ USING EVERY CONCEIVABLE BRANCH OF MAGIC, WE TRIED TO BRING THE STONE GUARDS BACK TO LIFE, BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN. OUR WISE MEN FEEL THAT ONLY SANSRI'S BLOOD CAN TAKE THE CURSE OFF THE EAGLES AND THE GUARDS."
