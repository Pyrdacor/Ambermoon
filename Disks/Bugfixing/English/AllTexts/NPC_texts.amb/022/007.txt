THERESA TAKES BOTH PARTS OF THE AMULET AND WORKS ON THEM AT HER BENCH. IT DOES NOT TAKE LONG AND SHE RETURNS AND GIVES YOU THE REPAIRED AMULET AGAIN. WITH A MIXTURE OF ANNOYANCE AND FEAR IN HER VOICE SHE SAYS:^ "THIS AMULET IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL! I WOULD NEVER ENGRAVE THE NAME OF THE GOD OF CHAOS INTO A AMULET. TAKE IT, AND GO QUICKLY FROM MY WORKSHOP!"
