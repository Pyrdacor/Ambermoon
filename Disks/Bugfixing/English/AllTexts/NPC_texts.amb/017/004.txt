"TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE COME FROM YOU MUST KNOW THAT AT THE SAME POINT WHERE LYRAMION EXISTS, THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF OTHER WORLDS ON OTHER LEVELS. THEY ARE ONLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY THIN BARRIERS.^ WE DISCOVERED THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS WITH THE MAGIC IN OUR WINGS, AND CAN NATURALLY VISIT THE OTHER WORLDS. YOUR WORLD APPEALS TO US BECAUSE OF THE MANY SHINY THINGS THERE ARE HERE, FOR WE LOVE ANYTHING WHICH SHINES AND SHIMMERS. BUT MY SISTER WAS CAPTURED BY THESE HORRIBLE MONSTERS AND WE ARE NOW VERY MUCH AFRAID OF YOUR WORLD."
