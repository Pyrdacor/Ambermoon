"MY SISTER'S NAME IS SELENA. THE MONSTERS THAT YOU CALL ORCS SURPRISED HER AND BROKE HER WINGS. IF I WERE STRONGER AND COULD HANDLE WEAPONS I WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO INTO THE ORC CAVES AND FREE HER. I HOPE JUST THAT SHE IS STILL ALIVE!^ BUT YOU ARE STRONG WARRIORS, COULD YOU NOT TRY TO SAVE HER? I WILL ALSO TEACH YOU OUR LANGUAGE BECAUSE SELENA UNDERSTANDS ALMOST NOTHING OF YOUR LANGUAGE. COME, IT IS VERY EASY!"^ SHE PLACES HER HANDS ON YOUR FOREHEADS, ONE AFTER THE OTHER, THEN CLOSES HER EYES AND CONCENTRATES. FINALLY, SHE SAYS IN THE SYLPHIAN LANGUAGE - AND TO YOUR SURPRISE YOU UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD:^ "OH YES, BEFORE I FORGET: DIRECTLY BEHIND THE ENTRANCE TO THEIR CAVE THE ORCS HAVE A STONE HEAD IN THE WALL WHICH IS APPARENTLY GUARDING THE ENTRANCE. IT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SAID OR ASKED. ONE OF THE ORCS CERTAINLY SAID >OKNARD<, BEFORE THEY ALL DISAPPEARED IN THE CAVE."
