A CROWD HAS GATHERED SPONTANEOUSLY ON A SQUARE CLOSE TO THE TOWN GATES. FROM DOZENS OF EXCITED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS YOU DRAW UP THE FOLLOWING PICTURE:^ AS THE DWARF PEOPLE LANDED ON THIS MOON MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO TODAY, IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THEY WERE BETRAYED BOTH BY THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR OWN DREAMS. THE PROPOSED PARADISE FULL OF EMERALDS AND OTHER PRECIOUS STONES PROVED TO BE A STEAMILY HUMID JUNGLE OF STRANGE PLANTS. DUE TO A LACK OF MORE NAVIGATION STONES THE HUGE AIRSHIP WITH WHICH THE DWARFS ARRIVED HERE COULD NO LONGER BE USED. THE FIRST YEARS WERE HARD FOR THE STRANDED PEOPLE. THE PLANT AND ANIMAL WORLD ON THE MOON INCLUDED SOME SPECIES WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS DID NOT INCLUDE HOSPITALITY AND FRIENDSHIP. MOST OF THE PREDATORS HAD DEVELOPED THE ART OF CAMOUFLAGE TO PERFECTION AND ATTACKED IN MOST SURPRISING SITUATIONS. THE DWARFS ALL SUFFERED PAINFUL SURPRISES AND MANY OF THEM FELL VICTIM BUT THEY SOON FOUND OUT WHAT ANIMALS AND PLANTS THEY COULD USE AS FOOD AND WHAT OTHERS WOULD REVERSE THAT SITUATION.^ AFTER OVERCOMING THEIR INITIAL DISAPPOINTMENT AND SHOCK, A STRONG CAMP WAS BUILT WHICH WAS GRADUALLY EXTENDED WITH NUMEROUS HARDWOODS TO FORM THIS TOWN. DESPITE THE JOURNEY BEING UNSUCCESSFUL, KIRE, THE LEADER OF THE DWARFS, INSISTED THAT BOTH THE TOWN AND THE MOON SHOULD BE NAMED AFTER HIM. MANY CITIZENS OF DOR KIREDON HOWEVER USE EXPRESSIONS LIKE "COMPOST HEAP" INSTEAD OF THE OFFICIAL NAME "KIRE'S MOON".^ THE DWARF PEOPLE ARE SAID TO BE THICK-HEADED AND SO THEY INITIALLY TRIED TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTING LIFESTYLE IN THE NEW WORLD. AS SOON AS THE QUESTIONS OF DAILY SURVIVAL WERE SOLVED THEY BEGAN TO EXPLORE THE MOON BELOW GROUND LEVEL. THE RESULTS WERE DEPRESSING: KIRE'S MOON PROVED TO BE VERY POOR WITH REGARD TO THE METALS IT CONTAINED AND JUST A FEW TRACES OF IRON AND MINERALS WERE FOUND, AND ONLY AT GREAT DEPTHS.^ AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS SOMETHING HAPPENED ABOUT WHICH MOST OF THE DWARFS YOU HEAR SPEAK WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE. HOWEVER, FINALLY YOU GATHER THAT AT THAT TIME SOME VOICES WERE RAISED WHICH WERE NOT JUST COMPLAINING ABOUT LIFE ON THE "COMPOST HEAP". MANY, PREDOMINANTLY THE YOUNGER DWARFS, HAD BECOME INVOLVED IN MORE DETAIL WITH THE NATURE OF THE MOON. THEY WENT INTO THE FORESTS TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW WORLD. THOSE THAT SURVIVED BROUGHT MORE KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION BACK WITH THEM. MANY OF THEM STAYED IN THE WILDERNESS FOR LONGER AND LONGER PERIODS AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THEY WERE BECOMING EXCITED ABOUT THE PLANTS AND THE ANIMALS ON THE MOON. A GROUP OF THESE FOREST VISITORS EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT ONE SHOULD NO LONGER CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE MOON AS AN ENEMY BUT SHOULD LEARN TO HANDLE IT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE BETTER.^ SUCH THOUGHTS WERE NATURALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO MANY OLDER, MORE TRADITIONAL DWARFS. FINALLY SOME OF THE DWARFS MOVED OUT TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN TOWN, DOR GRESTIN, WHERE THEY COULD LIVE HOW THEY WANTED.^ HOWEVER MUCH YOU LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE DWARF PEOPLE, THERE ARE ALWAYS MANY QUESTIONS YOU MUST ANSWER ABOUT YOURSELVES. YOU DESCRIBE THE SITUATION AT LYRAMION AND ~SELF~ REPORTS ABOUT SOME OF YOUR ADVENTURES. THE DWARFS LISTEN INTENTLY AND ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU WERE TRAVELLING ON SUCH A SMALL AIRSHIP AND THAT YOU ARE NOW IN THE SAME SITUATION AS THEY, WITHOUT A NAVIGATION STONE FOR THE SHIP. SO KIRE'S MOON IS NOW ALSO YOUR PLACE OF EXILE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.^ AT THIS POINT IN THE DISCUSSION THE LEADER OF THE DWARFS, KIRE HIMSELF, ARRIVES. HE ALSO WELCOMES YOU AND LISTENS TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. BUT THEN HE BREAKS UP THE MEETING AND SLOWLY THE DWARFS RETURN TO THEIR DAILY WORK, CHATTERING IN SMALL GROUPS. BEFORE KIRE RETURNS TO HIS WORK, HE ASKS YOU TO VISIT HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT THIS HOUSE IN THE NORTH WEST PART OF THE TOWN.^ YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE TOWN.
