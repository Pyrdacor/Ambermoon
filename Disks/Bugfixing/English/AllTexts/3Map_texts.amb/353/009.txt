~INK 30~ THE JOURNEY TO DOR KIREDON WAS UNEVENTFUL FOR THE GROUP AND DORINA. FINALLY YOU REACH THE TOWN AND ENTER KIRE'S RESIDENCE. WITHOUT HESITATING, DORINA GOES STRAIGHT TO THE THRONE ROOM AND ALMOST RUNS INTO KIRE, WHO STEPS OUT FROM BEHIND A COLUMN. THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER AS IF FROZEN. SECONDS PASS AND BECOME ENDLESS MOMENTS. KIRE AND DORINA BOTH OPEN THEIR MOUTHS AT THE SAME TIME AND CLOSE THEM AGAIN. IT IS CLEAR THEY ARE BOTH FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO SPEAK.^ THEN, HAVING BEEN APART FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, THEY FINALLY AND SILENTLY TAKE EACH OTHER IN THEIR ARMS. IT TAKES THEM SOME TIME TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS AND KIRE AND DORINA ARE FINALLY ABLE TO TALK AND LAUGH AS IF MAKING UP FOR TEN YEARS SEPARATION IN JUST A FEW SECONDS. YOU TURN TO WITHDRAW AND DORINA SAYS TO YOU:^ ~INK 31~ "DESPITE ALL OUR JOY WE SHOULD NOT FORGET WHO HAS MADE THIS POSSIBLE! COME HERE, MY FRIENDS!"
