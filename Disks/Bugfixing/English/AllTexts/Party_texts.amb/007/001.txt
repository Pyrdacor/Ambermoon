IN A QUIET, SAD VOICE THE MAN SAYS:^ "PLEASE COME CLOSER, THE EVIL HAS LEFT ME! TODAY I AM JUST LIKE THE LITTLE BOY I WAS A LONG TIME AGO. NOW I AM TAR AGAIN.^ ONCE I WAS LORD TARBOS, THE GOD OF CHAOS, AND I BROUGHT SO MUCH EVIL, SIN AND SUFFERING TO EVERYONE THAT I WANTED TO PUT AN END TO MY BLOODY LIFE. BUT HOW CAN I SETTLE THE DEBT I HAVE INCURRED. HOW CAN LYRAMION EVER FORGIVE ME FOR THE WOUNDS I HAVE CAUSED?^ AS I SEE, YOU ARE ABOUT TO SAVE LYRAMION FROM A GREAT DANGER. PLEASE LET ME JOIN YOU AND DEDICATE MY LIFE TO THIS GOOD DEED! PLEASE LET ME JOIN YOUR GROUP!"
