"I LEARNED THE SKILLS OF DESTRUCTIVE MAGIC FROM MY DEAR MASTER, TRASRIC. AROUND A YEAR AGO HE ENTERED THE REALMS OF ETERNAL SLEEP. MAY BALA GUARD HIS SOUL WITH KINDNESS!^ ON HIS DEATHBED HE TOLD ME OF THE TOWER OF THE OLD BLACK MAGICIANS AND ADVISED ME TO MAKE MY WAY THERE. HE SAID THAT I WOULD FIND OLD MAGIC SCROLLS AND OTHER MAGICAL THINGS THERE. HE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHICH HE CALLED THE SPHERE OF OPENING. APPARENTLY IT CAN BE USED IN A HOUSE CLOSE TO THE TOWER TO START A MECHANISM WHICH OPENS THE ENTRANCE DOORS TO THE TOWER.^ AT THE MOMENT I AM LOOKING FOR A GROUP TO JOIN ME TO FIND THE TOWER, BECAUSE I AM NOT EQUIPPED WELL ENOUGH MYSELF FOR SUCH A JOURNEY ON MY OWN."
