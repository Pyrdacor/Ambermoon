"OH, WHAT LUCK, YOU SPEAK MY LANGUAGE! I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE AND FELT I WOULD END UP BEING BOILED BY THIS TERRIBLE GIANT. I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.^ NEVERTHELESS, I CANNOT MAKE MY WAY BACK TO MY OWN WORLD BECAUSE MY WINGS ARE BROKEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO NOW. CAN I NOT STAY WITH YOUR GROUP? I AM QUITE A GOOD THIEF."
