"THE THIEVES AT THE GUILD IN SPANNENBERG AT LEAST HAVE SOMETHING AKIN TO HONOUR AMONGST THEM, BUT THE BANDITS WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR DIRTY DEEDS HERE FOR SOME TIME ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A GANG OF MURDERERS. I INTEND TO FIND THEIR SECRET HEADQUARTERS AND COLLECT THE REWARD THE BARON HAS OFFERED. RUMOUR HAS IT THAT THE BANDITS HAVE THEIR CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT TO THE NORTH OF SPANNENBERG."
