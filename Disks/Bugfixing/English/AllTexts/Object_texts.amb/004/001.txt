THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE RECIPE IS WRITTEN IS VERY OLD.^^ DEMON SLEEP^ A RECIPE BY MASTER ZENDRO, BLACK MAGICIAN^ THERE IS A SPECIAL TYPE OF DEMON, THE SO-CALLED GUARDIAN DEMON. NO MORTAL BEING HAS EVER GOT PAST SUCH A GUARD. THEY ONLY ATTACK IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GET INTO THE PLACE THEY ARE PROTECTING. THEY ARE SO POWERFUL THAT EVEN THE GREATEST MAGICIAN ON LYRAMION HAS NO CHANCE AGAINST THEM.^ BUT I, ZENDRO, HAVE NOW FOUND A WAY TO SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR CAVES. TO DO THIS, YOU MUST PUT THEM TO SLEEP, FOR WHEN THEY ARE ASLEEP THEY LOSE THEIR HOLD ON LYRAMION AND ARE DRAGGED BACK INTO THEIR HELL. UNFORTUNATELY I FOUND THAT NORMAL SLEEP SPELLS HAVE NO EFFECT. FOR THIS REASON I DEVELOPED A POTION WHICH BE GIVEN TO THEM. FOR THIS POTION YOU NEED:^^ ONE LEAF FROM THE FIRE THISTLE^ ONE PIECE OF FLINT STONE^ ONE PETAL FROM THE SWAMP LILY^ ONE RED MUSHROOM^ ONE BLUE MUSHROOM^ ONE KALMIR HERB^^ AND AN EMPTY PHIAL^ THIS RECIPE IS TO BE BREWED IN THE CAULDRON OF A WITCH OR A WITCH MASTER AND YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS TO HAND. BUT YOU MUST ENSURE THAT...^^ THIS IS WHERE THE TEXT BREAKS OFF.
