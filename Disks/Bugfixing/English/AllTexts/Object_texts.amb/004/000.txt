REPORT ON THE WIND GATES OF LYRAMION^ BY THONION THE SCHOLAR^^ 1. WHAT ARE WIND GATES?^ WIND GATES WERE CONCEIVED BY A GIFTED MAGICIAN AND INVENTOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO. THEY SERVED - AND STILL SERVE TODAY - TO QUICKLY BRIDGE GREAT DISTANCES ON LYRAMION. TODAY THERE ARE STILL TWELVE, OR MORE CORRECTLY, TWENTY FOUR WIND GATES ON LYRAMION. A GATE CANNOT OPERATE BY ITSELF. EACH TIME ONE WISHES TO USE ONE OF THE GATES, THERE MUST ALSO BE ANOTHER GATE ACTIVE AT THE INTENDED DESTINATION.^^ 2. WHAT DOES ONE NEED TO USE THEM?^ TRANSPORTATION THROUGH THE WIND GATES IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF YOU HAVE A SO-CALLED WIND CHAIN IN USE. TODAY THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THESE CHAINS LEFT. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MANUFACTURE NEW CHAINS. ON THE ISLAND OF WINDS THERE IS THE WIND SHRINE. IT HAS TWO ALTARS. IF YOU JOIN TOGETHER A CHAIN OF MOTHER OF PEARL AS WELL AS TWELVE WIND PEARLS ON THE RIGHT ALTAR, THIS WILL CREATE A NEW WIND CHAIN.^^ 3. WHAT DOES ONE DO IF A GATE IS DESTROYED?^ THE INVENTOR OF THE GATES ALSO DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO REPAIR DAMAGED GATES EASILY. TO DO SO YOU NEED A ROD MADE OF RARE XENOBIL WOOD AND A NORMAL GEM. THE ROD IS USED AT THE LEFT ALTAR IN THE WIND SHRINE. IT MELTS WITH THE GEM AND THEN BECOMES A ROD OF CONSTRUCTION. IF THIS IS MOVED CLOSE TO A DEFECTIVE GATE, IT IS REPAIRED AGAIN.
