SOMEONE WROTE THE FOLLOWING IN BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING ON A FEW PAGES OF PARCHMENT:^^ "TODAY ONE OF MY GREATEST FEARS CAME TRUE. SOME ANCIENT DARK FORCE ROSE FROM THE OLD TOWER OF THE BLACK MAGICIANS TO OVERPOWER US.^ THIS MORNING A HUGE RED DRAGON APPEARED IN THE SKY. IT DIVED DOWN OVER BURNVILLE AND WITH ITS FIREY BREATH SET ALL THE ROOFS ALIGHT. AS THE INHABITANTS CAME RUNNING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES, IT ROARED, SAYING SOMETHING LIKE:^ "LISTEN, YOU POOR LITTLE WORMS! MY MASTER, THE MASTER OF FIRE, HAS SEEN FIT TO MAKE YOU HIS SLAVES. HE GIVES YOU UNTIL TOMORROW TO CONSIDER. I SHALL RETURN THEN AND EXPECT YOUR ANSWER." THEN IT FLAPPED ITS MIGHTY WINGS AND ROSE HIGH UP IN THE SKY AGAIN. THE GALES IT CAUSED BLEW THE ROOFS OF SEVERAL OTHER HOUSES.^ WE HELD A MEETING THIS EVENING AND IT WAS DECIDED WE WILL NOT SURRENDER BUT WILL FIGHT."^^ "OUR PLAN OF RESISTANCE WAS A MISTAKE. THE DRAGON RETURNED EARLY THIS MORNING, AS ANNOUNCED. WHEN WE REFUSED TO SURRENDER, IT ROARED LOUDLY AND SUDDENLY THE SKY DARKENED WITH THE WINGS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER DRAGONS.^ IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR ALL THE INHABITANTS EXCEPT ME HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN NETS, MANY WERE BADLY BURNED AND HAD OTHER INJURIES AS WELL. THE DRAGONS FLEW OFF WITH THEM, PROBABLY TO THE TOWER. I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW I WAS NOT DISCOVERED IN MY HIDING PLACE. BUT NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO."^^ "I SPENT LAST NIGHT THINKING ABOUT WHAT I CAN DO NOW. BY THE MORNING I DECIDED TO GO TO SPANNENBERG AND ASK MY MOTHER FOR HELP."^^ "WHAT A PROBLEM! I DID NOT EVEN MANAGE TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL. SHORTLY AFTER I ENTERED IT A HUGE GIANT STEPPED FORWARD. HE LAUGHED REPULSIVELY AND SAID: 'LUMINOR, THE MASTER OF FIRE, HAS INSTRUCTED ME TO LET NO ONE THROUGH. BUT HE DID NOT SAY THAT I MUST LET YOU GO AGAIN. SO NOW YOU CAN SERVE AS MY DINNER.'^ HE RAISED HIS ARMS UP HIGH AND ENORMOUS BALLS OF FIRE HURTLED TOWARDS ME. I ONLY JUST ESCAPED THE INFERNO."^^ "I RECOVERED AS WELL AS I COULD IN JUST ONE NIGHT. I WILL GO TO THE TOWER NOW. PERHAPS THERE IS CHANCE OF FREEING THE PEOPLE OF BURNVILLE FROM THE CLUTCHES OF LUMINOR.^ MAY GALA BE WITH ME.^ SABINE^ CHIEF HEALER OF BURNVILLE"
