~INK 29~ THE SCROLLS SHOW THAT THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF A FOREST RUNNER BY THE NAME OF DREBLIN:^^ ~INK 31~ "IT WAS AN EFFORT TO FIND THE RUINS AGAIN. THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE FOREST. AS EXPECTED, AT THE ENTRANCE I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET ANY FURTHER THAN THE MASSIVE GREEN METAL GATE. SO NOW IT IS TIME TO TRY OUT THE CLIMBING EQUIPMENT."^^ "DONE IT! THE EQUIPMENT ENABLED ME TO CLIMB THE OUTSIDE WALL OF THE TOWER. I WAS ABLE TO LOOK BRIEFLY AT SOME OF THE STRANGE WALL DRAWINGS BUT THEN A GROUP OF GIZZEKS FORCED ME TO WITHDRAW THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE GROUND."^^ "I SUCCEEDED IN FORCING MYSELF THROUGH A SECOND OPENING UNDER A METAL PLATE. I HAVE NOW REACHED A DEEP PART OF THE OLD SYSTEM. I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING VALUABLE YET, SOME DOORS BLOCK THE WAY TO OTHER PARTS OF THE RUINS. AND HERE, TOO, MANY OF THE WALLS ARE DECORATED WITH STRANGE SYMBOLS. I HEAR NOISES. HOPEFULLY THE GIZZEKS ARE NOT FOLLOWING ME."^^ "THE SYMBOLS APPEAR TO BE VERY IMPORTANT; THEY ARE ALSO FOUND NEXT TO THE DOORS. THE SPHERES ON THE DOORS CAN BE DEPRESSED, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS.^ APPARENTLY THE SYMBOLS REPRESENT A SYSTEM OF NUMBERS. TRIANGLES COULD SYMBOLISE NUMBERS. THE ROUND SYMBOLS ARE UNKNOWN, PERHAPS THEY ARE MULTIPLIERS? ARE SYMBOLS NEXT TO EACH OTHER SIMPLY TO BE ADDED TOGETHER? PROBABLY. RED TRIANGLES COULD BE THE NUMBER 1. ORANGE WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE..."^^ ~INK 29~ THIS IS WHERE THE LETTERS STOP AS IF A LINE HAD BEEN DRAWN STRAIGHT ACROSS THE PARCHMENT.
