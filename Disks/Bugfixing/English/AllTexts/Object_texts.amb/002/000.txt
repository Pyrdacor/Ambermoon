THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY OLD BOOK, FOR THE WORDS ARE SO FADED THAT YOU CAN HARDLY READ THEM. THE ONLY PASSAGE YOU CAN DECIPHER IS THE FOLLOWING:^^ "THE COMMON GREATER POISON SPIDER OR GIGANTEA ARACHNIA POISONIA ^ THIS SPIDER HAS TWO NATURAL AND DANGEROUS CHARACTERISTICS:^ 1. ITS POISON. THIS DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT VERY QUICKLY BUT IS ALWAYS FATAL.^ 2. ITS WEB. IT IS NOT STICKY LIKE THE WEBS OF MANY OTHER SPIDERS BUT ITS THREADS ARE AS GOOD AS INDESTRUCTIBLE. IT IS EASILY POSSIBLE FOR SUCH A WEB TO MAKE ANY PASSAGEWAY TOTALLY INPENETRABLE. ONLY WITH THE AID OF F.R. (THIS WORD IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE) CAN IT BE DESTROYED. PROBABLY BY SOMEONE WHO HAS A .OR.H (THIS WORD, TOO, HAS ALMOST TOTALLY DISAPPEARED). GENERALLY, THIS TYPE OF SPIDER LIKES TO LIVE IN OLD, DAMP CELLARS."
