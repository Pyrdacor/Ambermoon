MOST PAGES OF THE BOOK HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, JUST THE LAST FEW ENTRIES ARE STILL LEGIBLE:^^ "TODAY WE COMPLETED OUR WORK ON THE MACHINES IN THE LOWER PART OF THE TEMPLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD. THE THING WHICH STILL WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THESE MACHINES CAN BE USED FOR. BUT THAT IS NOW IRRELEVANT, AS THE REWARD FOR OUR WORK WILL MAKE OUR GREATEST DREAM COME TRUE: WE WILL REACH THE GREEN JEWEL!" TOMORROW ALL THE DWARFS OF GEMSTONE WILL CLIMB ON BOARD THE STRANGE SHIP OF THE BROTHERHOOD AND START THEIR LONG JOURNEY. BUT ALTHOUGH I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED, I AM NOT. I DOUBT WHETHER WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT NOW IT IS TOO LATE! THE JOY THE DWARFS ARE FEELING ABOUT GETTING TO THE GREEN JEWEL IS SO GREAT THAT I COULD DO NOTHING ELSE TO STOP THEM.^ THE THING WHICH STILL TROUBLES ME IS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WEAR THEIR COWLS SO LOW OVER THEIR FACES THAT ONE CAN'T SEE THEIR FACES. I CANNOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING LOOKED ONE OF THEM IN THE FACE.^^ SO, NOW WE ARE LEAVING GEMSTONE AND MUST HAND OVER OUR TOWN TO THE FORCES OF NATURE. MAY NATURE DO WITH IT WHATEVER SHE WISHES.^^ KIRE, CHIEF OF THE DWARFS OF GEMSTONE."
