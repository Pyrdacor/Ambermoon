IT HAPPENED ONE DREADFULLY HOT SUMMER. A BIRD OF PARADISE, HALF DEAD FROM THIRST, WAS FLYING OVER THE LAND IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING TO DRINK. BUT IT DID NOT EVEN FIND A SMALL PUDDLE, FOR THE SUN HAD DRIED UP EVEN THE PONDS AND LAKES. SUDDENLY, IN FRONT OF A FARMHOUSE, IT SAW A LARGE WELL WITH SPARKLING WATER INSIDE IT. IT FLEW DOWN AND PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE WELL, REACHING DOWN TO DRINK THE WATER... OH DEAR, ITS BEAK WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE WATER! SO IT SAT THERE IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND WOULD SOON DIE OF THIRST. SO CLOSE TO LIFE AND YET SO FAR AWAY!^ THEN A WART HOG CAME BY AND SAID: "I SAW YOUR DIFFICULTY FROM AFAR. I WILL HELP YOU IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR FEATHERS SO THAT I CAN DRESS MYSELF UP IN YOUR BEAUTY." THE BIRD OF PARADISE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. THEN IT TORE OUT ITS FEATHERS AND GAVE THEM TO THE HOG. THE HOG SAID: "TAKE A FEW ROCKS AND DROP THEM INTO THE WELL. THIS WILL RAISE THE WATER LEVEL AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO DRINK."^ IN A FLASH, THE BIRD DID AS THE HOG SUGGESTED. WITH ONE LAST MIGHTY EFFORT IT PICKED UP LOTS OF ROCKS AND DROPPED THEM IN THE WATER WELL. AND, SURPRISE, SURPRISE, THE WATER LEVEL ROSE TO WITHIN HIS REACH. IT SAVED HIS LIFE.^ AND THE MESSAGE OF THIS STORY? BEAUTY IS NICE IN LIFE, BUT WITH INTELLIGENCE YOU LIVE LONGER!
