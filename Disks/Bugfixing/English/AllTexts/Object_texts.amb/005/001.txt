BROM, MY BRAVE WARRIOR, LET ME GIVE YOU AN IMPORTANT JOB: SCOUT AROUND OUR NEW WORLD AND WATCH OUT FOR ONE OF THOSE AIRSHIPS! IF POSSIBLE, GET ON BOARD ONE OF THESE SHIPS AND TRY TO GET HELP ON LYRAMION. PERHAPS WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE WE WILL SUCCEED IN GETTING AWAY FROM THIS DREADFUL FOREST.^ I WAS ABLE TO PUT ONE OF THESE NAVIGATION STONES TO ONE SIDE. IT IS HIDDEN IN THE OLD DWARF MINE. YOU NEED EIGHT DIFFERENT STONES TO CLEAR THE WAY INTO THE TREASURE CHAMBERS OF THE DWARF MINE:^^ 1. TOPAZ^ 2. RUBY^ 3. EMERALD^ 4. EARTH STONE^ 5. QUARTZ CRYSTAL^ 6. RAINBOW STONE^ 7. DIAMOND^ 8. AMBER GEM^^ GOOD LUCK! KIRE
