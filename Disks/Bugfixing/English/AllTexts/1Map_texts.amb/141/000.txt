THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU SEE A LARGE DINING TABLE AT WHICH SEVERAL BANDITS ARE SEATED. ONE OF THEM SAYS:^ "I HOPE THAT SILVERHAND WILL SOON HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF SPANNENBERG. THERE IS NOT MUCH LEFT THERE. WE SHOULD MOVE ON. I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOLD IN BURNVILLE."^ THEN HIS NEIGHBOUR ELBOWS HIM IN THE RIBS AND SAYS:^ "KALEB, YOU SHOULD NOT CALL THE MASTER MAGICIAN THAT. YOU KNOW HOW HE HATES THAT NICKNAME."
