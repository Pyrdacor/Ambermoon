AN ELF WOMAN SAYS:^ "HELLO, STRANGERS! HAVE YOU COME TO ILLIEN TO LISTEN MATTHIAS, THE MASTER OF MUSIC, PLAY? YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T MISS IT. HIS SKILL ON THE ELF HARP IS FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE LAND. AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE ALSO SELLS ELF HARPS. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SAID TO BE EXPENSIVE, I BELIEVE THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY."
