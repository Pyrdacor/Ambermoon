THE BEGGAR IS VERY TALKATIVE. AMONGST OTHER THINGS, HE TELLS YOU:^ "THE TEMPLE OF SANSRI IS BASICALLY OPEN TO EVERYONE. AT LEAST TO THOSE WHO CARRY THE STONE OF SANSRI WITH THEM.^ BUT I WARN YOU! LOOK AT ME: I HAVE BECOME AN OLD MAN BECAUSE I VISITED THE TEMPLE TOO OFTEN. FOR EACH TIME YOU LEAVE THE TEMPLE THE STONE OF SANSRI FALLS TO DUST AND YOU MUST BUY A NEW ONE FROM THE DEALER HERE IN SNAKESIGN. THIS OLD SHARK HAS BECOME A VERY RICH MAN AND I WOULD BET ANYONE THAT HE IS SHARING HIS PROFITS WITH THE PRIESTS OF SANSRI."
