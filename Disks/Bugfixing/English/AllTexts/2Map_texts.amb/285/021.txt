A YOUNG MAN WITH LONG BLOND HAIR WELCOMES YOU AND SAYS:^ "HELLO, EVERYONE, I AM SORRY BUT I HAVE NO TIME FOR A LONG CHAT. I MUST PREPARE MYSELF FOR A GREAT JOURNEY. I WANT TO GO TO THE LARGE FOREST ISLAND EAST OF HERE. THE MASTER OF THE FOREST IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR A NEW APPRENTICE. YOU NEED TO KNOW THERE ARE STRANGE XENOBIL TREES IN THE FORESTS ON THE ISLAND. THEIR WOOD IS SO VALUABLE THAT EVEN A SINGLE STICK IS WORTH MORE THAN EVEN THE WHOLE TOWN OF BURNVILLE."
