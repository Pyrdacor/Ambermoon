BEFORE YOU STANDS A MORANIAN WITH A LOT OF GREY SPOTS ON HIS SKIN. HE NOTICES YOU LOOKING AT HIM AND SAYS:^ "YES, JUST LOOK AT MY GREY FLECKS! I WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF THIRST SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY AND I AM THE LAST OF MY FAMILY. THE OTHERS ALL DIED HORRIBLE DEATHS.^ BUT WHAT CAN WE SIMPLE LIZARDS DO? THE HIGH COUNCIL HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH WATER. I HAVE HEARD THAT THE PALACE OF THE HIGHEST COUNCILLOR IS EVEN SURROUNDED BY A HUGE DEEP MOAT. BUT IF ANYONE DARES DRINK FROM IT, HE HAS THEM PUT TO DEATH."
