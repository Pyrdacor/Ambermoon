AS YOU ENTER THE TORTURE CHAMBER, YOU ARE MET BY A BLAST OF HEAT. THE SOUND OF BOILING FILLS THE ROOM AND THE AIR REEKS OF SULPHUR. TO THE SOUTH WEST YOU SEE A LARGE POOL MADE OF HUGE SKULLS IN WHICH LAVA IS BOILING.^ SUDDENLY YOU NOTICE THE WEAK GROANING SOUNDS AND CRIES FOR HELP FROM A DISTANT PART OF THE ROOM. BEHIND AN AREA CLOSED OFF BY IRON BARS YOU SEE MANY STARVING, EMACIATED BEINGS LYING OR CROUCHING. SOME OF THEM APPEAR TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND TRY TO PULL THEMSELVES UP USING THE IRON BARS.^ TO THE SOUTH OUTSIDE THE CELL IS A WOMAN DRESSED IN THE CLOTHING OF A HEALER. AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE, SHE IS TRYING DESPARATELY TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CELL.
