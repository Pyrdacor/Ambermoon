AN OLD MAN SUDDENLY APPEARS FROM NOWHERE IN THE ROOM. HE FIRST LOOKS AT YOU IN SILENCE BUT THEN HE SAYS IN A SONOROUS VOICE:^ "HOLD ON! MY NAME IS NAGIER AND I AM THE MASTER OF THE BANDITS. YOU KILLED MOST OF MY PEOPLE AND NOW I ONLY HAVE A HANDFUL OF HELPERS LEFT. SO I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR YOU. YOU CAN EITHER HAVE ONE LAST VERY FIERCE BATTLE OR I PROMISE YOU I WILL LEAVE SPANNENBERG IN PEACE AND ALSO TRAIN YOU IN THE SKILL OF CRITICAL HITS.^ THE CHOICE IS YOURS!"
