YOU GET INTO A DISCUSSION WITH AN ELF WARRIOR WOMAN. SHE LOOKS AT YOU CAUTIOUSLY AND THEN SAYS:^ "AS SOON AS I CAN, I WILL FLY WITH AN EAGLE TO THE OLD FORT OF GODSBANE. I HAVE HEARD THAT A NOBLE PALADIN IS SLEEPING THERE AND HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS FOR THE TIME WHEN HE IS NEEDED. I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED MIGHTY WARRIORS. HIS NAME IS SAID TO BE GRYBAN."
