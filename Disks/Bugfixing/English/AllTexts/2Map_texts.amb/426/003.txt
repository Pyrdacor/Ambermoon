THE OLD MAN LOOKS AT YOU QUIZZICALLY AND THEN SAYS:^ "YOU HAVE CERTAINLY ALREADY HEARD OF THE ENORMOUS WHIRLPOOL TO THE WEST OF THE FORT OF GODSBANE? BEFORE THE GREAT FLOODS YOU COULD GET THROUGH IT INTO AN UNDERGROUND CAVE. BUT NO-ONE SHOULD TRY THAT TODAY BECAUSE THE CAVE ENTRANCES WERE BLOCKED BY THE CATASTROPHE AND ANYONE WHO DARES TO ENTER THE WHIRLPOOL WILL SURELY BE TORN TO PIECES."
