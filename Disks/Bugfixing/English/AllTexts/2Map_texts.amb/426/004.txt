THE TOWN GUARD SAYS:^ "I ONCE WENT TO THE TEMPLE ISLAND OF THE BROTHERHOOD TO COLLECT SOMETHING FOR THE BARON. THE MONKS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WERE ALREADY WAITING FOR ME IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE AND GAVE ME THE PACKAGE FOR THE BARON. AS I WAS LEAVING, I GLANCED INTO THE ENTRANCE HALL. I ALMOST DIED OF SHOCK BECAUSE A HUGE DEMON WAS CROUCHING DOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL. I CAN TELL YOU, PEOPLE, NOT EVEN TEN HORSES COULD EVER DRAG ME BACK TO THAT DAMMED ISLAND."
