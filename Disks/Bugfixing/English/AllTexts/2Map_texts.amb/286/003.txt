BEFORE YOU LIES AN OLD WOMAN IN BED. ALMOST ALL OF HER BODY IS WRAPPED IN BANDAGES. HER FOREHEAD IS WET WITH PERSPIRATION AND SHE JABBERS AND CRIES DELIRIOUSLY:^ "NO, PLEASE, NOT THE RED HOT HOOK, NO, NO, NO!" PLEASE, YOU CAN TELL LUMINOR THAT I WILL NEVER SPEAK AGAINST HIM EVER AGAIN AND WILL ALWAYS BE HIS SLAVE, IF YOU JUST STOP THIS TORTURE." PLEASE, PLEASE.....!!"^^ A YOUNG HEALER COMES RUNNING TO HER BED AND TAKES THE WOMAN'S HEAD LOVINGLY IN HER HANDS. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE OLD WOMAN QUIETENS DOWN AND APPARENTLY FALLS ASLEEP. THE HEALER SMILES AT YOU AND SAYS:^ "OLD MERIL SUFFERED BADLY IN LUMINOR'S PRISON. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE AGAIN. BUT THAT IS STILL BETTER THAN DYING AT THE HANDS OF LUMINOR.^ THANK YOU AGAIN FOR RELEASING US."
