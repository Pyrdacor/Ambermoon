AHEAD OF YOU IS A LARGE CAVERN IN WHICH YOU SEE SEVERAL YOUNG WOMEN. THE STRANGE THING IS THAT THEY HAVE BLUE OR GREEN SKIN AND LONG SHIMMERING WINGS.^ WHEN THEY NOTICE YOU, THEY ALL FLAP THEIR WINGS WILDLY EXCEPT FOR ONE OF THEM. A REDDISH LIGHT SPREADS OUT AROUND THEM. THEN THERE IS A SUDDEN FLASH AND THEY ARE GONE.^ JUST THE ONE REMAINS STANDING IN THE CAVERN, LOOKING AT YOU WITH WIDE EYES FULL OF FEAR.
