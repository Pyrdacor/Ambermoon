YOUR GRANDFATHER IS BURIED IN THIS GRAVE.^ YOU LOOK AT IT QUIETLY AND FEEL PAINFUL GRIEF BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT WITH HIM AT THE HOUR OF HIS DEATH.^ BUT SUDDENLY YOU HEAR A GENTLE VOICE:^ "DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF, ~SELF~, IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT! TRY TO FIND THE GRAVE OF SHANDRA AND USE HIS PIECE OF AMBER!"^ "GRANDFATHER!" YOU CALL LOUDLY, BUT THE VOICE REMAINS SILENT.
