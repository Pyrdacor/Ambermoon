THE CORRIDOR IS CLEARED AGAIN AFTER SOME WORK WITH THE PICKAXE.^ JUST AS THE LAST LARGE ROCK ROLLS TO ONE SIDE YOU HEAR A LONG SCREAM OF PAIN. IT SEEMS TO COME FROM FAR AWAY, JUST AUDIBLE THROUGH THE TONS OF ROCK AND EARTH ABOVE YOUR HEAD.^ SHORTLY AFTER THE SCREAM DIES AWAY YOU BELIEVE YOU HEAR SIGHS OF RELIEF, SIGHS FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS REACHED THE END OF A LONG JOURNEY. A JOURNEY FULL OF SUFFERING.
