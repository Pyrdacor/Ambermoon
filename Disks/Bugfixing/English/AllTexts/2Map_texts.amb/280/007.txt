YOU ENTER THE ROOM AND ARE WELCOMED BY A FEARFUL ROAR. A HUGE FIGURE RISES FROM AN ENORMOUS TABLE AND STEPS TOWARDS YOU:^ "ARE THE KITCHEN STAFF ASLEEP? WHY ARE YOU NOT IN THE PAN? I AM HUNGRY!"^ THEN THE FACE OF THE GIANT WIDENS INTO A BROAD BUT NOT VERY PLEASANT GRIN AND, MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO ANYONE ELSE, HE GRUMBLES:^ "NO MATTER, RAW MEAT IS SAID TO BE VERY HEALTHY. WILL DO REG GOOD!"^ HE RAISES HIS HUGE CLUB AND STEPS CONFIDENTLY TOWARDS YOU.
