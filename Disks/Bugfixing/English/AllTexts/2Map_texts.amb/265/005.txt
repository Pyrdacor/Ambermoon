SUDDENLY A WONDERFUL DIMENSION GATE OPENS NEXT TO YOU AND A YOUNG MAN COMES OUT.^ "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED, YOU CHEATS!^ MY NAME IS KARSTEN AND I DO NOT LIKE IT IF YOU CHEAT WHEN PLAYING MY GAME.^ THE ONLY HONEST WAY TO FIND OUT THE PASSWORD IS TO SWAP THE NECROMANCY BROOCH. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WILL ESCAPE FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH YOUR LIFE. BUT YOU MUST BE PUNISHED!"^ WITH THESE WORDS HE RAISES HIS ARMS AND A HUGE FIREBALL FLIES TOWARDS YOU.
