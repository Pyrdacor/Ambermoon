~LEAD~ IS JUST BENDING DOWN TO LIFT THE RING WHEN YOU SUDDENLY HEAR A LOUD BANGING FROM A COFFIN NEAR THE ENTRANCE. THEN ITS LID BURSTS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES. A HORRIBLY UGLY UNDEAD IN FINE BUT VERY ANCIENT ROBES BEARING MAGICAL SYMBOLS CLIMBS OUT OF THE COFFIN AND STANDS IN THE ENTRANCE TO THE CRYPT. HE SEEMS TO EXAMINE YOU CAREFULLY WITH HIS EMPTY EYE SOCKETS. APPARENTLY SATISFIED, HE SCRATCHES HIS BALD SKULL AND DRONES IN AN UNNATURALLY DEEP AND REVERBERANT VOICE:^ "YOU MORTAL MIDGETS DARE TO DISTURB MY PEACE?!^ FOR THAT I WILL MAKE YOU INTO MY UNDEAD SERVANTS, JUST LIKE THE OTHERS."^
