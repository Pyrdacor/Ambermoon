YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TRIGGERED AN INAUDIBLE MECHANISM - ANYWAY THE GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE. AS YOU MOVE CLOSE TO THE HUGE COFFIN, BUT BEFORE YOU REACH IT, ITS LID CREAKS OPEN. ROOTED TO THE GROUND, YOU STAND STILL AS IF FROZEN SOLID WHILE A GIGANTIC DEMON STRETCHES UP OUT OF THE COFFIN. HE REACHES HIS FULL HEIGHT, LOOKS AROUND WITH FLASHING EYES AND THUNDERS AT YOU IN A VOICE WHICH ALMOST BLASTS YOU AWAY:^ "AH, MORTALS! BE AFRAID, FOR TARBOS, THE GOD OF CHAOS, IS FREE AGAIN!"^ THEN HE LOOKS DOWN AND, WITH A CRY OF RAGE HE HOWLS:^ "AAARRGHH! WHY HAVE I BEEN SEPARATED FROM TAR?^ ITS YOUR FAULT, YOU MISERABLE PILES OF DUST! YOU WILL DIE FOR THIS, AND RIGHT NOW, AS TRUE AS I AM THE KING OF HELL!"^ HE BREAKS INTO AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE ROARING AND, IN THE DEAFENING NOISE, ~LEAD~ SHOUTS TO THE GROUP:^ "THAT IS THORNAHUUN! OUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY!"
