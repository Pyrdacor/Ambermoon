YOUR GRANDFATHER LIES IN BED BEFORE YOU, VERY ILL. HIS CHEST RISES AND FALLS SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY, WITH A HORRIBLE RATTLING NOISE.^ HIS EYES STARE BLANKLY AT THE CEILING. WHEN HE NOTICES YOU, A LITTLE LIFE RETURNS BUT HIS ATTEMPT TO BRING A SMILE TO HIS LIPS ENDS IN A FIT OF COUGHING.^ WHEN HE PARTLY RECOVERS, HE WHISPERS QUIETLY:^ "MY BELOVED GRANDCHILD, ~SELF~, PLEASE COME CLOSER AND LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY! I HAVE SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU BEFORE I ENTER THE REALMS OF BALA..."^ EXHAUSTED, HE CLOSES HIS EYES.
