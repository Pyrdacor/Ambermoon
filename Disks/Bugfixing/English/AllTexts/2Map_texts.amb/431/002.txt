~LEAD~ LETS ~SEX2~ FINGERS GLIDE OVER THE STRINGS OF THE HARP AND A HEAVENLY SOUND REVERBERATES THROUGH THE HALL. ~LEAD~ PLAYS FASTER AND LOUDER, SYSTEMATICALLY PLAYING IN DIFFERENT KEYS. AS ~SEX1~ ALMOST REACHES THE LOWEST STRINGS, A GENTLE TREMBLE PASSES THROUGH THE TEMPLE AND THE CRYSTAL WALL BEGINS TO CRACK. ~LEAD~ PLAYS MORE LOUDLY AND THE WALL SUDDENLY BURSTS INTO MYRIADS OF TINY SHARDS.
