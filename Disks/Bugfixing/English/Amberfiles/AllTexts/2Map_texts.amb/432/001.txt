AS YOU ENTER THIS ROOM CAUTIOUSLY, YOU SEE ONE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE BROTHERHOOD IN A SPLENDID CLOAK AND TWO OF THE MAGIC GUARDS, ALL LOOKING IN YOUR DIRECTION AS IF THEY ARE EXPECTING YOU. THE PRIEST CALMLY DROPS HIS COWL AND, TO YOUR HORROR, YOU SEE THE HEAD OF A LIZARD ON A HUMAN BODY.^ HE NOTICES YOUR HORROR AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A SMILE RUNS OVER HIS SCALY LIPS. THEN HE SPEAKS TO YOU IN A RATTLING BUT STRONG VOICE:^ "COME IN, YOU WORMS FROM LYRAMION, LOOK AROUND! YOU ARE TOO LATE TO STOP THE MACHINE BELOW THE TEMPLE STARTING ITS WORK VERY SOON.^ AH, I SEE WONDERMENT IN YOUR FACES - PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON? THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT, ANYWAY, BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE TO DIE!"^ WITH THESE WORDS HE RAISES HIS ARMS IN A FLASH AND A HUGE FIREBALL HURTLES THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS YOU.
