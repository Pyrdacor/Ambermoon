"A RING - THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT,^ AND SO I'LL STEP ASIDE."^ WITH THESE WORDS THE SECTION OF WALL BEFORE YOU DISAPPEARS.^ YOU JUST START TO MOVE THROUGH THE OPENING AND THE WALL RUSHES DOWN AGAIN. THE STONE HEAD SAYS:^ "I DO NOT RHYME VERY WELL BUT I LIKE IT,^ FORGIVE ME, YOU CLEVER PEOPLE.^ ONLY VERY SELDOM DOES ANYONE LISTEN TO ME,^ SO IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO KEEP QUIET."^ AND THEN THE WALL DISAPPEARS AGAIN. YOU LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE AND THEN MOVE TOWARDS THE PASSAGEWAY AGAIN. BUT THE WALL COMES BACK DOWN AND THIS TIME IT NEARLY CRUSHES ~LEAD~'S FOOT.^ YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU IMAGINED IT, BUT THE EXPRESSION ON THE FACE OF THE STONE HEAD APPEARS A LITTLE GUILTY AS IT SAYS:^ "I DON'T WANT TO BE A NUISANCE,^ BUT A RHYME HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME.^ WITH THIS VERY TRUSTED SENTENCE^ I WILL NOW REALLY LET YOU BE."^ AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THESE WORDS ARE SPOKEN, THE WALL DULY DISAPPEARS AGAIN.^ SHAKING YOUR HEAD, BUT AMUSED, YOU ARE AGAIN STANDING BEFORE THE OPEN PASSAGEWAY. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF HESITATION ONE OF YOU CAREFULLY MOVES A FOOT TOWARDS THE PASSAGEWAY AND THIS TIME IT APPEARS TO STAY OPEN. MAYBE THE STONE HEAD CANNOT THINK OF ANY MORE RHYMES.
