A WELL-DRESSED ELF IN CONVERSATION WITH YOU SAYS:^ "HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF TARBOS? I SAW ONE OF THEIR PRIESTS DURING MY LAST VISIT TO NEWLAKE. AS HE WENT PAST ME A GUST OF WIND BRIEFLY LIFTED HIS COWL AND I THOUGHT I SAW SCALY GREEN SKIN, SO I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS HUMAN. IN MY OPINION SANSRI HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS."
