THE YOUNG MAN IS APPARENTLY VERY KEEN ON TALKING TO YOU. HE TALKS ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND THEN HE SAYS:^ "MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME THAT SANSRI HAD WINGED SNAKES AS GUARDS IN HER TEMPLE BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD. BUT THEY WERE APPARENTLY ALL KILLED BY THE FLOOD. SO A FEW YEARS AGO SHE GOT NEW GUARDS.^ I SAW ONE OF HER GUARDS IN THE TEMPLE A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A STONE OF SANSRI. A HUGE MINOTAUR IT WAS, HALF MAN AND HALF BULL. ITS HUGE HORNS ALONE FRIGHTENED ME, QUITE APART FROM ITS ENORMOUS AXE."
