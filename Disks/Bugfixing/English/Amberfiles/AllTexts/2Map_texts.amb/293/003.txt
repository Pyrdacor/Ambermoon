WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR THE PRISONERS DRAG THEMSELVES OUT AS WELL AS THEY CAN. MOST OF THEM ARE BADLY INJURED AND YOU HELP THEM TO CARRY THE WEAKEST.^ EVERYONE STUTTERS THEIR THANKS AND MANY OF THEIR EYES ARE FULL OF TEARS. YOU HEAR THAT MOST OF THE PRISONERS HERE COME FROM BURNVILLE AND EVERYONE INVITES YOU TO GO THERE.^ A MAN WHO IS ONLY HALF ABLE TO STAND, SAYS:^ "I AM CAPTAIN TORLE AND I OWN THE BOATYARD OF SPANNENBERG. IF YOUR TRAVELS PERMIT, PLEASE VISIT ME THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY GRATITUDE TO YOU FOR RELEASING ME."
