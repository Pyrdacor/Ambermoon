AN OLD MAN WITH A STICK CHATS WITH YOU FOR A WHILE. HE SAYS:^ "HAVE YOU ALREADY VISITED THE TOWER WHICH SCRAPES THE SKY? A MAGICIAN BY THE NAME OF LEBAB BUILT IT. HE FELT THAT AT THAT HEIGHT HE COULD GAIN GREATER MAGICAL ABILITIES. IF YOU WOULD FIND THE TOWER OF INTEREST, LEAVE BY BOAT FROM THE WEST COAST AND ALWAYS HEAD TO THE NORTH WEST."
