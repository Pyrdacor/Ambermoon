WHEN THE BLINDING LIGHT DISAPPEARS, YOU FIND THAT YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT A COOL PLACE SURROUNDED BY WALLS.^ UNANNOUNCED, SOME MAGIC GUARDS AND A MORANIAN APPEAR BEFORE YOU. THE MORANIAN PUSHES HIS COWL BACK AND SAYS:^ "AH, JUST LOOK, OUR WOULD-BE HEROES HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED! I KNEW YOU WOULD SOON BE APPEARING HERE. YOU MAY HAVE FINISHED OFF S'OREL ON LYRAMION AND S'RIEL, THE OLD FOOL, MAY HAVE JOINED YOUR GROUP, BUT YOUR FUN STOPS HERE. EVEN IF YOU GET PAST MY WARRIORS YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO STOP THE MACHINE ON LYRAMION, AS TRUE AS MY NAME IS S'ARIN."^ WITH THESE LAST WORDS HE DISAPPEARS IN A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT AND THE MAGIC GUARDS ATTACK YOU.
