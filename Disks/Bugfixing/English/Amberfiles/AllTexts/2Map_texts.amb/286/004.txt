A YOUNG HEALER WOMAN STANDS BEFORE YOU, CARRYING A PILE OF BANDAGES IN HER ARMS. SHE SAYS:^ "AH, HERE ARE OUR SAVIOURS! EVERYONE IS SO HAPPY THAT LUMINOR'S TERROR IS AT AN END. APART FROM THOSE WHO ARE BADLY INJURED, WHO WE ARE LOOKING AFTER HERE, ALL THE OTHERS HAVE GONE BACK TO THEIR NORMAL LIVES IN THE TOWN. NOW PLEASE EXCUSE ME, I MUST CHANGE SOME DRESSINGS."
