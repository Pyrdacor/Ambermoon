AS YOU PRESS SHANDRA'S STONE ON THE LID OF THE COFFIN, IT SUDDENLY BEGINS TO GLOW. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, A MISTY FIGURE APPEARS ABOVE THE COFFIN:^ "WELCOME, WELCOME! I AM THE ESSENCE OF SHANDRA. MY TIME HERE ON LYRAMION IS LIMITED AND WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU CAN BE SAID QUICKLY:^ A GREAT DANGER LIES OVER LYRAMION, AND IF YOU DO NOT HURRY, IT IS DOOMED. SO YOU MUST GO TO THE TEMPLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF TARBOS AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN. EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE DECIDED BY YOUR FATE THERE.^ THE ONLY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU IS A KEY. IT LIES IN MY COFFIN AND IT FITS A SECRET DOOR IN THE MAIN LIBRARY AT NEWLAKE. IN THE ROOM BEHIND THE SECRET DOOR, YOU WILL FIND A RECIPE. WITHOUT THIS RECIPE YOU WILL NOT GET INTO THE TEMPLE OF THE BROTHERHOOD.^ NOW LIVE LONG, AND DO YOUR BEST!"^ WITH THESE WORDS, THE FIGURE FADES AWAY, AND JUST A THIN MIST REMAINS.
