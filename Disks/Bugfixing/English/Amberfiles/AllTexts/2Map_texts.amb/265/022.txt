AS YOU TRY TO OPEN THE SHOP DOOR YOU HEAR A QUIET RINGING SOUND AND YOU ARE SUDDENLY SURROUNDED BY THIEVES. A VERY LARGE WELL-BUILT MAN STEPS FORWARD AND SHOUTS LOUDLY:^ "TELL ME, CAN'T YOU READ? THE SHOP IS ONLY OPEN FROM 1 AM TO 8 AM! GO AWAY AND COME BACK LATER WHEN IT IS OPEN."^ WITH THESE WORDS THE THIEVES MOVE ON.
