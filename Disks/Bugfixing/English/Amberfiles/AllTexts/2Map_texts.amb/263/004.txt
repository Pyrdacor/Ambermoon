AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR TO THE OFFICE AT THE BOATYARD A YOUNG BOY COMES TOWARDS YOU. HE SAYS:^ "I AM VERY SORRY BUT UNFORTUNATELY CAPTAIN TORLE IS NOT HERE. A FEW MONTHS AGO HE WENT TO VISIT RELATIVES IN BURNVILLE AND HAS NOT RETURNED. AS I AM ONLY THE APPRENTICE I CANNOT TAKE AN ORDER FOR A BOAT.^ IF YOU GO TO BURNVILLE, PLEASE TELL HIM HE SHOULD RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
