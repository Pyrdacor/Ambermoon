YOU SUMMON ALL YOUR COURAGE AND STEP CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE HEDGE. YOU LOOK AROUND AND SUDDENLY SEE THE GLOWING RED EYE SOCKETS OF SKELETONS AND ZOMBIES. THEY CLAMBER OUT OF AN OPEN GRAVE TO THE SOUTH EAST AND STAGGER TOWARDS YOU. BEHIND THE JERKING MASSES OF BONE AND FOUL FLESH YOU FEEL YOU CAN MAKE OUT THE FIGURE OF AN OLD MAN IN A ROTTEN CLOAK. IT SEEMS AS IF HE IS DIRECTING THE UNDEAD.
