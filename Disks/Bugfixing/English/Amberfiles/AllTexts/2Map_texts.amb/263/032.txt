THE OLD MAN LEANS ON HIS STICK AND SAYS:^ "I HAVE HEARD THAT FAR TO THE NORTH NEAR THE TOWER OF THE ALCHEMIST THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OLD CRYPT. IT IS SAID THAT POWERFUL MAGICIANS WERE LAID TO REST THERE MANY YEARS AGO. THEY ALSO SAY THAT ALKEM, THE ALCHEMIST, GOT INTO THE CRYPT SEVERAL TIMES TO SEARCH FOR MAGIC ARTEFACTS.^ I WOULD NOT GO THERE AT ANY PRICE. A MAGICIAN WHO IS ALIVE COULD VERY EASILY COST YOU YOUR LIFE. AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU MET AN UNDEAD MAGICIAN?"
