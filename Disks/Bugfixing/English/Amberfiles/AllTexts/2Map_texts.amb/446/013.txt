S'ARIN STANDS IN THE ROOM BEFORE YOU AND SPEAKS:^ "YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE POWER THAN I THOUGHT! BUT ALL YOUR STRENGTH WILL NOT HELP YOU, FOR YOU NEED MY HARP STRING. AND YOU WILL NOT GET IT, BECAUSE FOR THAT YOU MUST FIGHT WITH MEEEEEE!"^ WITH THESE WORDS HE RAISES HIS ARMS AND A BRIGHT LIGHT HURTLES INTO YOUR GROUP.
