AS ~LEAD~ TOUCHES THE NECHLACE THERE IS A SUDDEN LOUD EXPLOSION AND LIGHTNING FLASHES AROUND THE GROUP. THEN, WITH A THUNDEROUS ROAR, A BLUE LIGHT GATE OPENS BEFORE YOU THROUGH WHICH YOU CAN SEE INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD. IN A ROOM BEHIND THE GATE YOU SEE TWO SHADOWY FIGURES.^ SUDDENLY ONE OF THE FIGURES IS HIT BY A FLASH OF LIGHT AND CATAPULTED TOWARDS YOU THROUGH THE GATE. WITH AN ENORMOUS THUNDERING SOUND THE GATE CLOSES AND ALL LIGHTS GO OUT.^ FOR A MOMENT IT IS DEATHLY STILL, THEN YOU HEAR ANGRY GROWLING.
