YOU SEE THE OPENING TO A NARROW PASSAGE FLANKED BY POWERFUL STONE STATUES. SOME GARGOYLES ARE JUST PREPARING TO FLY THROUGH THE PASSAGE, WHEN SUDDENLY, THE STATUES COME TO LIFE. FOR A MOMENT YOU SEE NOTHING BUT LEATHER THONGS AND WILD STONE FISTS FLYING ALL AROUND.^ THEN THE STATUES BECOME MOTIONLESS AGAIN AND THE REMAINS OF THE GARGOYLES LIE ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN THEM.
