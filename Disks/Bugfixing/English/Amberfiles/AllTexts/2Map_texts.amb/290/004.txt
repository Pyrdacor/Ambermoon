AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG BEARD AND A BLUE MAGICIAN'S ROBE SPEAKS TO YOU:^ "WELCOME TO THE SCHOOL OF MAGICIANS! MY NAME IS NALVEN AND I AM THE MASTER OF THIS SCHOOL.^ CURIOUSLY NO PUPILS HAVE ARRIVED AT ALL IN RECENT WEEKS. DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT COULD BE? I ONLY COME INTO TOWN OCCASIONALLY, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.^ BUT ANYWAY, NOW YOU ARE HERE. IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR MAGIC SKILLS, PLEASE GO TO ONE OF THE PRACTICE ROOMS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MAGIC SCROLLS, YOU WILL FIND THEM IN THE LIBRARY."
