IN THE CELL YOU SEE A MAN CLOTHED IN RAGS, WANDERING UP AND DOWN RESTLESSLY. SUDDENLY, A LITTLE MOUSE RUNS INTO HIS CELL. WHEN THE MAN NOTICES IT, HIS EYES TAKE ON A STRANGE THREATENING GLOW. HE SUDDENLY RAISES HIS ARMS AND A FLASH OF LIGHT TURNS THE MOUSE INTO A PILE OF DUST. THE MAN LOWERS HIS ARMS AND CONTINUES HIS RESTLESS WANDERING.
