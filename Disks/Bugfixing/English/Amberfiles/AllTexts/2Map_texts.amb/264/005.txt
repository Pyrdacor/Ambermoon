AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG GREY BEARD WELCOMES YOU:^ "HELLO, MY NAME IS LANDIS!"^ AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW PLEASANTRIES, HE SAYS:^ "I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO AVOID THE GRAVEYARD BEHIND THE HOUSE OF THE HEALERS, FOR I HAVE HEARD THAT GORDON, THE GRAVEYARD GARDENER, HAS STARTED TO RECALL THE DEAD TO AN UNNATURAL LIFE. I PERSONALLY NEVER TRUSTED HIM, ANYWAY. AND CERTAINLY NOT ANY MORE SINCE HE BOUGHT EVERY POSSIBLE BOOK ON NECROMANCY."
