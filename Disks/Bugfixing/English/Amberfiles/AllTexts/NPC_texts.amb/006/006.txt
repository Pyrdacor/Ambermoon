"WELL, YOU WANT TO HEAR THE STORY OF THE MAD MAN.^ AS I UNDERSTAND FROM MY PREDECESSOR, HE SWAM TO OUR COAST SHORTLY AFTER THE GREAT DISASTER. THE ONLY THING HE HAD WITH HIM AT THAT TIME WAS A TORN BUT COSTLY ROBE AND HALF OF A STRANGE AMULET. I BELIEVE BOTH THESE ITEMS ARE NOW KEPT IN A BOX DOWN IN THE CELLAR.^ HE WAS TAKEN IN BY A FARMER FAMILY AND LIVED THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL THE HOUSE OF HEALERS WAS ESTABLISED HERE IN SPANNENBERG. IN THE PAST HE BECAME MORE AND MORE VIOLENT. ONLY LAST YEAR HE BADLY INJURED TWO CARERS WITH A HUGE FIREBALL. BEFORE HE WENT MAD HE MUST HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT MAGICIAN. IF YOU VISIT HIM, DO NOT GO INTO HIS CELL. SPEAK TO HIM ONLY THROUGH THE BARS.^ IN CONFIDENCE, THE REALLY STRANGE THING ABOUT HIM IS NOT THAT HE IS MAD BUT THAT HE HARDLY SEEMS TO AGE AT ALL. HE HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE.
