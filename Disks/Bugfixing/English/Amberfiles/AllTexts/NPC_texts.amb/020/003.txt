"I PAINT LARGE PICTURES IN OILS. A SHORT TIME AGO, I COMPLETED A COMMISSION FOR THE BARON OF NEWLAKE. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEG INJURY WHICH I SUFFERED IN LUMINOR'S PRISON IS STOPPING ME FROM TAKING THE PAINTING TO NEWLAKE MYSELF. SO I WOULD BE PLEASED IF YOU COULD DO ME THAT FAVOUR.^ HERE, THIS IS THE PICTURE. IT IS CALLED >AMBERMOON<. PLEASE JUST GIVE IT TO THE BARON. I HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR IT. I THINK HE WILL REWARD YOU GENEROUSLY WHEN YOU TAKE HIM THE PAINTING."
