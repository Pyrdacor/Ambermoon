"MY WORD, ~SELF~, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? JUST WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER NEEDED YOU SO MUCH, YOU WERE NOT THERE. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND CALLED YOUR NAME AS LOUD AS I COULD.^ NOW YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS GONE INTO BALA'S REALMS ALONE. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AT LEAST VISIT HIS GRAVE AT THE CHURCH IN SPANNENBERG.^ OH YES, BEFORE I FORGET, YOUR GRANDFATHER GAVE ME A KEY FOR YOU. HE SAID IT FITS THE CUPBOARD IN HIS BEDROOM. I HAVE PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN YOUR ROOM.^ I AM NOW GOING BACK TO SPANNENBERG. IF YOU NEED ME, I WILL BE IN THE TEMPLE AT THE HOUSE OF HEALERS."^ WITH THESE WORDS, HE TURNS AND LEAVES THE HOUSE.
