"SO, DORINA IS A COUSIN OF MINE AND IS, OR BETTER WAS, KIRE'S WIFE. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE. IT TOOK PLACE MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO.^ BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED, SHE VISITED US VERY OFTEN, EVEN IF MAINLY TO PLAY WITH MY NEWBORN BABY SON. THE WHOLE THING IS A SAD LOSS FOR US ALL. NOT JUST THAT DORINA WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON - IN CONFIDENCE SHE WAS ALSO THE MOST GIFTED MAGICIAN OUR PEOPLE HAVE PRODUCED FOR MANY MANY YEARS.^ YOU OUGHT TO TALK TO OLD BROG ABOUT HER. HE IS NOW THE ONLY ONE OF US WHO KNOWS ABOUT THE SECRET ARTS. BROG IS A FREQUENT VISITOR HERE, YOU CAN MEET HIM IN THE EVENINGS."
