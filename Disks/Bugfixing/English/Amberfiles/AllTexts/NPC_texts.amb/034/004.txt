WHEN THE OLD MORANIAN SEES YOUR WATER FLASK, HE BRINGS A BALL WITH A YELLOW CROSS OUT OF A CHEST. HE HOLDS IT OUT TO YOU AND SAYS URGENTLY:^ "OH HEAVENS OVER MORAG, YOU HAVE SOME WATER! I MUST DRINK SOMETHING OR I WILL DIE. PLEASE LEAVE ME THE FLASK AND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS MAGIC BALL FOR IT! IT HAS BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS. MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME IT CAN BE USED TO OPEN A DOOR INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD IN WHICH STRANGE CAT PEOPLE LIVE."
