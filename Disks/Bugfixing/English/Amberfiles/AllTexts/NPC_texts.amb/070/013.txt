"HE ALMOST DIED OF EXCITEMENT WHEN WE RETURNED TO PEGANA WITH THE DRAGON! HE WOULD NOT CALM DOWN AND AFTER A FEW DAYS WITH THE DRAGON AND US HE HAD TO BE FORCED TO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE! NOW ALSO DAMBRANO IS EXTENDING HIS MAGIC FACULTY. IN TRUTH THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON WHY WE DO NOT DO THIS TOGETHER: HERE ON THE OUTSIDE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO CARRY OUT EVEN LARGER EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF PEGANA, HOWEVER, ARE AFRAID OF MAGIC BEING USED IN PUBLIC."
