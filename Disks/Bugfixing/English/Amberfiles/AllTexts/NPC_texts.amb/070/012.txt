"DOBRANUR IS STAYING WITH HIS GREAT-UNCLE, DAMBRANO, IN PEGANA AT THE MOMENT. HE IS TAKING TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE FESTIVITIES. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE MY OLD FRIEND DOES NOT IN FACT KNOW WHAT DIRECTION HE SHOULD TAKE IN HIS LIFE. AT THE MOMENT HE IS TRYING TO CONTINUE STUDYING MAGIC AT DAMBRANO. I HOPE HE FINDS IT SATISFYING."
