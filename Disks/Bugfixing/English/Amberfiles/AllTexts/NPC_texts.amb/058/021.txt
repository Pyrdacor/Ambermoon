"WELL, NOW YOU HAVE SHOWN MY FAMILY SUCH GREAT SERVICE, I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF OUR BEST KEPT SECRETS. TWO YEARS AGO ONE OF OUR MOST SKILFUL SCOUTS DISCOVERED THE REMAINS OF A CIVILISATION WHICH MUST HAVE COLLAPSED THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE WE LANDED HERE.^ DREBLIN, FOR THAT IS HIS NAME, FOUND THE RUINS IN ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF THIS MOON. HE RETURNED THERE TO CHECK ON ITS SECRETS. BUT HE HAS BEEN OVERDUE BACK HERE FOR A LONG TIME. IF WE WANT TO FIND THE RUINS, THEY ARE TO THE NORTH NORTH WEST OF DOR GRESTIN."
