"HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR GREEN TOWN? GRESTIN IS AN OLD DIALECT WORD MEANING SOMETHING LIKE 'VERSATILE' OR 'COMPREHENSIVE'. SINCE WE MOVED FROM DOR KIREDON TEN YEARS AGO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE ON OUR GREEN MOON, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THEM. OUR SUCCESS PROVES WE ARE RIGHT: WE HAVE LEARNED MUCH AND WE HAVE ONLY LOST VERY FEW PEOPLE."
