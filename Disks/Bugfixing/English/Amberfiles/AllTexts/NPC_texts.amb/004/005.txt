"WHAT, YOU DO NOT KNOW NEWLAKE? I MUST ADMIT I WAS ONLY THERE ONCE WITH MY FATHER WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY. AFTER THE HUGE DISASTER THE SURVIVORS OF TWINLAKE ESTABLISHED A NEW TOWN IN THE FOREST TO THE NORTH WEST OF THE RUINS. THEY CALLED IT NEWLAKE. WITH ILLIEN, THE TOWN OF THE ELVES, IT IS TODAY ONE OF THE LARGEST TOWNS ON THE LYRAMION ISLANDS."
