"MANY THANKS FOR SAVING MY VALUABLE HORSE SHOES! I AM VERY ATTACHED TO THEM BECAUSE THEY BRING ME LUCK AND I WAS AFRAID THE BANDITS WOULD MELT THEM DOWN.^ HERE IS A SHOVEL AND A PICKAXE. I WILL ADD A CROWBAR, TOO. SO YOU SEE HOW GENEROUS I AM: FOR SO LITTLE GOLD YOU HAVE GOT SO MUCH IRON FROM ME, HA-HA."
