"YOU BRAVE MEN! FATHER TOLD ME WHAT AN EFFORT IT WAS FOR YOU TO SAVE MY LIFE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM.^ I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO AT LEAST TAKE THIS RING. MY FATHER GAVE IT TO ME A FEW YEARS AGO. HE FOUND IT ONCE IN A BIG FISH. THE STRANGE THING ABOUT IT IS IF YOU HOLD IT UNDER WATER, THE NAME SOBEK APPEARS ON ONE SIDE."
