"WELCOME, STRANGERS! PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I TROUBLE YOU WITH A REQUEST!^ YESTERDAY EVENING I WAS ROBBED BY BANDITS AND NOW HAVE NO GOLD LEFT AT ALL. BUT I MUST URGENTLY CONTINUE MY JOURNEY. FORTUNATELY THE THIEVES OVERLOOKED MY MONSTER EYE AND MY ONLY OPPORTUNITY NOW IS TO SELL IT. LOOK HERE, THIS IS THE MAGIC EYE MADE OF THE STRANGE KYRA STONE. IT IS USED TO SHOW YOU IF YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY MONSTERS, HENCE THE NAME.^ ARE YOU PERHAPS INTERESTED? I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU FOR 5,000 PIECES OF GOLD."
