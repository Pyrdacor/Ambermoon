"THANK YOU, THANK YOU! PLEASE TAKE THIS GOLD AS A REWARD. IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT AN EASY MATTER.^ IF MASTER ROTTERMUND GAVE YOU THE PICTURE, YOU MUST BE VERY TRUSTWORTHY, FOR I KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH. PERHAPS YOU ARE THE RIGHT ONES TO SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR ME.^ A FEW WEEKS AGO SEVERAL UNDEAD ROSE OUT OF THE CRYPT IN NEWLAKE. MY GUARDS DISCOVERED THEM IN GOOD TIME AND SO WERE ABLE TO PREVENT THE WORST FROM HAPPENING, BUT I HAD TO SEAL THE CRYPT AGAIN. THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM, BUT THE CRYPT IS THE BURIAL PLACE OF SHANDRA, AND MANY PILGRIMS WANT TO GO THERE.^ WHAT I NEED ARE A FEW TRUSTWORTHY BRAVE MEN WHO CAN CHECK WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE. OH YES, I SEE IN YOUR FACES THAT YOU WILL NOT REFUSE. HERE IS THE KEY TO THE CRYPT."
