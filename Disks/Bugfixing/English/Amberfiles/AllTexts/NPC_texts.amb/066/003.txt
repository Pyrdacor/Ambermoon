"FOR ME, MAGIC CANNOT HEAL EVERYTHING. I ONLY USE IT IN DIFFICULT CASES OR CHARGE A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT, FOR I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE NATURAL HEALING POWER OF THE BODY. ALSO A LONG REHABILIATION TEACHES US TO BE MORE CAREFUL WITH LIFE IN THE FUTURE.^ OFTEN THE USE OF MAGIC IS JUSTIFIED, HOWEVER, AS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PATIENT IN THE BEDROOM, A POOR CHAP FROM THE MINES OF DOR KIREDON."
