THE BARON TAKES THE LETTER AND READS IT IN SILENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES.^ "THE OLD MAGICIAN SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE MAN. I WILL ACCEPT HIS PROPOSAL AND LEAVE HIM IN PEACE IF HE DOES NOT BOTHER THE TOWN ANY MORE.^ AS YOU HAVE FREED THE TOWN OF THE BANDITS, I AM GIVING YOU THE REWARD I PROMISED."^ WITH THESE WORDS THE BARON BRINGS OUT A HUGE KEY AND HANDS IT TO YOU.
