"YES, FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS SOME STRANGE BANDITS HAVE BEEN PLUNDERING THE TOWN. AND MORE THAN THAT, THEIR ACTIONS ARE CASTING THE GUILD OF THIEVES INTO A BAD LIGHT.^ WE SIMPLY CANNOT MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE CITIZENS OF SPANNENBERG THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BANDITS. WE USED TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. EVERYONE HAS THEIR JOB AND IT DID NOT BOTHER THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAD OURS."
