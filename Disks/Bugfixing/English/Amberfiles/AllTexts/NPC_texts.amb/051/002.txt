"IT IS NOW TEN YEARS SINCE KIRE HAD THE ARGUMENT WITH HIS SON, KETNAR. YOU SEE, HE IS A GOOD LEADER BUT OCCASIONALLY HE CAN BE QUITE DEMANDING AND UNREASONABLE. WHEN KETNAR LEFT THE HOUSE, KIRE'S WIFE DORINA COULD NOT BEAR THE SHOCK. A SHORT TIME LATER SHE, TOO, DISAPPEARED.^ KIRE ATTEMPTED TO PLAY THINGS DOWN, BUT I BELIEVE HE IS TODAY STILL SUFFERING BADLY FROM HIS LOSS."
