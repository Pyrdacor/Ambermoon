"DORINA'S DEPARTURE DISTURBED ME DEEPLY, ESPECIALLY AS MY BROTHER, THE HEALER, WENT TO DOR GRESTIN AT THE SAME TIME. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT DORINA HAS AN UNUSUALLY WELL DEVELOPED GIFT FOR MAGIC SPELLS AMONGST OUR PEOPLE.^ HER TALENT EXTENDED SO FAR THAT SHE COULD CREATE CONTINUOUS ILLUSIONS AND IMAGES. AFTER SHE PRACTISED WITH ME IT BECAME CLEAR THAT IF SHE CONCENTRATED TOTALLY SHE COULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE REAL MATERIALS BY MAGIC. KIRE HATED ME FOR THAT BUT SINCE THEY THINK I AM WEIRD ANYWAY, IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO PUT PRESSURE ON ME.^ WHAT HAS BECOME OF DORINA NOW? OUR UNHAPPINESS CONTINUES SINCE WE WERE STRANDED ON THIS DAMN PLANET."
