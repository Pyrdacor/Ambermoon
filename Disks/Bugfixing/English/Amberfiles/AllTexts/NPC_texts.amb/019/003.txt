"I DRAW MAPS OF LYRAMION. IT IS HIGH TIME WE HAD AN ACCURATE ATLAS OF LYRAMION AGAIN. SO FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM TRAVELLERS AND SEAFARERS.^ JUST A FEW DAYS AGO I COMPLETED THE MAP OF THE LYRAMION ISLANDS AND HERE ARE THE FIRST FEW PRINTS. IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN HAVE ONE. BUT I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE MAP IS QUITE COMPLETE."
