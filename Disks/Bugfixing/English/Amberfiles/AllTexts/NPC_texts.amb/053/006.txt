"THE TORNAKS? NATURALLY I KNOW THOSE BEASTS. A REAL PLAGUE! WE HAD SOME VICTIMS EVEN NEAR DOR GRESTIN, UNTIL WE DISCOVERED SOMETHING WHICH KEEPS THE BEASTS AWAY: EACH OF US TAKES A TORNAK EGG WITH US ON LONG JOURNEYS. THIS ACTUALLY STOPS THEM ATTACKING US. APPARENTLY THEY DO NOT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING THE EGG."
