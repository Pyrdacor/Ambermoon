"AH, FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ME! FOR YOU ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE I CAN TRUST. I DO NOT GET ON WITH MERA'S SON AT ALL, FOR HE CANNOT BEAR CATS. HE THREW ME OUT OF THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVED. ALTHOUGH I CLAWED HIS FACE, HE TOOK HIS EVIL REVENGE AND BURNED OFF HALF MY TAIL.^ I WILL TELL YOU WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SECRET. SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE HIM PAY FOR MY TAIL. SIMPLY TOUCH THE WALL IN THE CELLAR TO THE SOUTH OF THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLAR STEPS."
