AS YOU START TO GO ROUND THE VOLCANO YOU SUDDENLY HEAR THE VOICE OF AN ORC:^ "THOSE BRIGHT-WINGED BEINGS HAVE TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE! YOU HEARD IT YOURSELF DURING THE TORTURE SESSION THAT THERE WERE MORE OF THEM! YOU THREE SEARCH THROUGH THE CAVE, THE OTHERS COME LOOKING OUTSIDE WITH ME!"^ THEN A FEW ORCS COME TOWARDS YOU. WHEN THEY SEE YOU THEY GRAB THEIR WEAPONS AND RUSH AT YOU.
