MOST OF THE ENTRIES ARE WRITTEN USING STRANGE SYMBOLS WHICH YOU CANNOT READ. ONLY THE FOLLOWING PASSAGES ARE WRITTEN IN LYRAMIONIC:^^ "OH, MASTER S'LORWIN, YOUR PLAN WITH THE DWARFS SUCCEEDED BEAUTIFULLY. THEY WERE PREPARED TO WORK FOR YEARS TOWARD THEIR DREAM. THEY COMPLETED THE MACHINE AND I TOOK THEM ON THE FLYING SHIP TO THE CONTAMINATED FOREST MOON.^ HA, THOSE LITTLE FOOLS, TO BELIEVE THE MOON WAS JUST ONE ENORMOUS JEWEL! THEY WERE REALLY QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I DUMPED THEM THERE. IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET AWAY AND LEAVE THEM BEHIND. NOW THAT THERE ARE NO MORE DWARFS HERE ON LYRAMION, NO ONE WILL HEAR OF OUR PLANS."^^ "MASTER S'LORWIN, AS INSTRUCTED, I WANTED TO EXAMINE THE BURIAL CHAMBER ON THE MOON WHICH CRASHED DOWN, BUT UNFORTUNATELY A DOOR STOPPED ME ENTERING THE CHAMBER. THE DOOR BEARS THE IMAGE OF A TWELVE-POINTED STAR. I EXPECT WE NEED SUCH A STAR TO OPEN THE DOOR.^ WITH REGARD TO YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A GODLIKE BEING BY THE NAME OF TARBOS I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I HAVE NOT MET HIM YET. BUT THE LEGENDS ABOUT TARBOS HAVE BEEN OF GREAT HELP TO US IN KEEPING OUR PLAN SECRET, FOR NO-ONE ON LYRAMION DOUBTED THAT TARBOS WOULD HAVE PLAGUED LYRAMION AGAIN A LONG TIME AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR OUR BROTHERHOOD."^^ "OH, MASTER S'LORWIN, I HAVE GREAT NEWS FOR YOU! THE WORK IS FINISHED AND THE MACHINE HAS BEGUN OPERATION. IN A FEW MONTHS IT WILL MAKE OUR WORLD FERTILE AGAIN. OF COURSE, THAT WILL MEAN THE END FOR LYRAMION, BUT WHO CARES! WE ARE THE MIGHTY ONES, AND THEREFORE WE ARE ALSO THE MORE VALUABLE ONES!"^^ "MASTER S'LORWIN, I HAVE HEARD THAT A BAND OF ADVENTURERS ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT OUR PLANS. A CERTAIN ~SELF~ IS SAID TO LEAD THE GROUP. JUST LET HIM COME HERE! EVEN IF HE SHOULD GET PAST THE GUARD DEMON, WHICH HE SIMPLY CANNOT, HE STILL HAS TO DEAL WITH ME."
