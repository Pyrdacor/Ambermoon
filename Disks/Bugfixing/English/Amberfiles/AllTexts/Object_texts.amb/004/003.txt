THE LAST PALADIN^ BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD THERE WERE MANY: AFTER THE FLOOD ONLY ONE IS STILL ALIVE: HIS NAME IS GRYBAN. HIS LIFE IS DEDICATED TO LIGHT AND HE WAS PUT TO ETERNAL SLEEP BY THE MIGHTY MAGICIANS. NOW HE RESTS ON A BED OF MARBLE AT THE FORTRESS OF GODSBANE AND AWAITS THE DAY WHEN HE IS NEEDED AGAIN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE DARKNESS.
