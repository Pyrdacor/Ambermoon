### Thalion office

This is map 257 (hex 101). I added two text popup events:
- Lift event should be triggered at 23,17 and 24,17 (text index 2)
- Stair event should be triggered at 14,16 and 15,17 (text index 3)

Tile data inside the map file starts at 0x14C. The map width is 40.

So for example to get to the event index for tile 23,17 you have to do the following:
1. Tiles are 1-based in game but 0-based in data so use x=22,y=16 for calculations.
2. The tile data is organized as rows so to get the tile index do y\*map_width+x. TileIndex = 16\*40+22 = 662.
3. Each tile on a 2D map uses 4 bytes of data so the byte offset inside the tile data is 662\*4 = 2648 (hex A58).
4. As mentioned tile data starts at 0x14C inside the map file so add this and get the total offset as 14C+A58=BA4.
5. Inside the 4 bytes of tile data the second byte contains the event index that should be triggered. So add 1 to the offset and get BA5.
6. Set this byte (should be 0 before) to the associated event index (see below).

At 0x14AC the event section starts. It started with 00 07 which is the amount of event chains on the map that can be reference through event index 1 to 7
in the tile data. As we want to add 2 new text popup event chains we have to change this to 00 09.

After this there are n event indices (2 bytes each) where n is the amount of event chains we just changed.
To make it short each of them represent the starting event index of an event chain.
So as the amount changed we have to add 2 new words (4 bytes in total) at 0x14BC.

Currently the map has 8 events (7 event chains but 8 single events). We will add 4 events.

Event index | Description
--- | ---
8 | Popup text at lift
9 | Action which disables the previous popup once triggered
10 (0xA) | Popup text at stairs
11 (0XB) | Action which disables the previous popup once triggered

We will make 2 event chains out of it as mentioned:

Event chain index | Description
--- | ---
7 | Popup lift -> Disable this popup
8 | Popup stairs -> Disable this popup

So coming back to the 2 new words we added they have to represent the first event index of each chain.
The first word is therefore 00 08 and the second word is 00 0A.

After that there is the total amount of events (not chains now!) which should be 00 08 before changing.
This should now become 00 0C (decimal 12) as we added 4 events.

With all data changes now it's time to add the real events. The last existing event ends now at 0x1522.
So there we will add the data for the 4 events. As each event has always 12 bytes we add 4\*12=48 bytes there.

Now we fill those bytes with life. Use the following bytes:

04 FF 03 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 09
0E 01 01 00 00 00 40 07 00 00 FF FF
04 FF 01 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 0B
0E 01 01 00 00 00 40 08 00 00 FF FF

Each row is one event. The first byte is the type (4 = text popup, E = action). I won't go much into each
value now but for the text events the text index is located at the 6th byte (here 2 and 3).
The action bits use values 400X to disable specific events. The last digit corresponds to the event chain
index you want to disable (7 and 8).

The last two bytes of each event gives a follow-up event (next event in the event chain). So the text
popups reference the action events there while the actions use FFFF which means (no more event).

Now let's finish the map by reference the event chains from tiles. You can calculate the tile data offsets
as shown above. Here the summary:

- Set byte at offset 0x0BA5 from 00 to 08 (left lift door)
- Set byte at offset 0x0BA9 from 00 to 08 (right lift door)
- Set byte at offset 0x0AE5 from 00 to 09 (upper stair tile)
- Set byte at offset 0x0B89 from 00 to 09 (lower stair tile)

Note that the event chain indices are 1-based inside the tile data. This is the case because 0 would mean
no event on the tile at all. So 9 means event chain 8 (0-based).
