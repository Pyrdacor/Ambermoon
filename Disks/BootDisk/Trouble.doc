THE PROGRAM ASKS FOR THE SAVE-GAME DISK (DISK J)!
  Before you start playing you must use the installation program to create a
disk which is used to save your positions during the game. You can use any
disks you like, but since this disk will be accessed very often, we advise
you to use a high-quality disk. The installation program will automatically
format and prepare the disk. All the old contents of the disk will be deleted!
After you have created the save-game disk, load AMBERMOON by re-booting your
computer. Insert the save-game disk (disk J), when the program asks for it.

ALL THAT DISK-SWAPPING IS STARTING TO IRRITATE ME!
  Sorry, but please believe us when we tell you that we went through a lot of
trouble to reduce the disk-swapping to a minimum. But AMBERMOON really is a
gigantic program with huge amounts of data and thus the swapping of disks
cannot be avoided completely. Nevertheless, here are some tips that will make
the playing from floppy disk a bit easier :

- Disable the music in the options menu. Matthias Steinwachs, our musician,
  won't be pleased about that, but it will save you some disk-swapping.
  Because all scenarios in the game access the same music-file, this disk is
  required very often.

- If you use more than one disk-drive, leave the save-game disk in one of
  them (all changes in the game and the automaps are saved here) and/or
  disk G, which also contains often-used files.

- Consider buying a hard-disk. Small hard-disks can be bought for a small
  amount of money.

AND THE LOADING TIMES COULD BE A BIT SHORTER TOO!

  If you have an Amiga which has a Kickstart version 2.0 or higher, or you
have installed a FFS(Fast-File-System)- driver, something can be done. Format
nine disks using FFS, then copy all the files from the original AMBERMOON-
disks to the right FFS-disk. THEN rename all the disks so they have the same
names as the AMBERMOON-disks (take care that you give the right name to the
right disk). You will find an exact description of how to do this in your
Amiga manual. When everything worked out, the game will load everything quite
a bit faster than before. Sadly, we were unable to bring out the game on FFS-
disks, since computers with a Kickstart version below 2.0 (and without an
FFS-driver) would be unable to read these disks.

SAVED GAMES
  If you want to backup your saved games or impress a friend with your amazing
party, here's how to do it :

  If you play from disk, just copy your save-game disk (disk J).

  If you play from hard-disk, you must copy the following files and
directories, which you will find in the >Amberfiles<-directory (which itself
is in the >Ambermoon<-directory) :

- All directories beginning with >Save.<, i.e. >Save.00< to >Save.10<.
- The file called >Saves<.

****************************************************************************

NOT ENOUGH MEMORY

Error reported :
>There is not enough free memory.<
>There is not enough CHIP memory available.<
>There is not enough memory available.<

During the game :
>A restart will now be attempted.<
>The program will now deactivate the music.<

If the program complains about lack of memory, there are several ways to
create more free memory :

- Hard-disk :
  Use the installation program's option >Create a boot disk<. The program
  will create a disk (deleting all the previous contents in the progress),
  which will load AMBERMOON from the hard-disk as soon as you turn on your
  computer. All memory-gobbling additional programs are skipped, and there is
  no need for you to change anything on your hard-disk.

- Hard-disk :
  You cand deactive memory-intensive programs from you startup-sequence or
  WBStartup-directory. The above-mentioned method is easier though.

- Floppy and hard-disk :
  If you regularly encounter the above-mentioned in-game reports, switch
  off the music in the options menu.

- Floppy disk :
  If have only 1Mb memory but 3 or more disk-drives, memory can be tight.
  Remove one of the drives.


FILE ERROR

Error reported :
>Directory not found.<
>File not found.<
>Read error< or >Checksum error< during installation.

If you're playing from hard-disk :
  The best solution is to re-install the game. To avoid having to start all
over again, backup your saved games to disk or to another directory. You
can find out how to do this in the document under the header SAVED GAMES.
  If you have re-installed, the current saved game can be damaged. In this
case select START NEW QUEST in the main menu. In the game you can then try
to load one of your other saved games.

If you're playing from floppy disk :

  ...one of your disks is probably defect. When you have made a backup of
your original disks, make a new copy of the bad disk. If you haven't, send
is your original disks together with a description of your problems and we'll
working disks back to you.

During installation to hard-disk :

  If the OS reports an error during installation, your original disks are
probably defect. Send us the original disks and we'll send working disks
back to you.


INTERNAL ERROR

Error reported :
>The OS reported an error during the game.<
>68000 address error exception.<
>68000 illegal exception.<
>68000 divide by zero exception.<
>A text is too long after merging.<
>A text is too long after processing.<
>There's an endless loop in the event chain.<
>UNKNOWN ERROR.<

  Errors of this kind shouldn't occur at all. If they do, we apologize. A
bug has eluded our testplayers. Please restart your computer and just try to
play on. It is possible that this kind of error doesn't occur every time.
If the error is persistent and you are unable to continue, please send us the
following in a padded envelope :

- The exact error report.
- Your original disk A.
- An exact description of your actions in the game before the error occurs.
- An exact description of your hardware
  (which Amiga model, how much memory, which peripherals, Kickstart-version,
  etc.)
- If you're playing from floppy disk, a copy of your save-game disk.
- If you're playing from hard-disk, a backup of your saved games
  (see above : SAVED GAMES).

We will send you a new version as soon as possible.
