# Character file format spec

On 07.02.2023 Jurie Horneman found and released the original specs. The associated spec can be found here now: https://github.com/Pyrdacor/ambermoon-source/blob/main/documents/AMBEDOCS.ORD/CHARDATA.TXT

This also revealed that the format ordered the values by size. First all bytes, then all words, then all long-words and then the character name.

This format is used for the following files:
- Monster_char_data.amb
- NPC_char.amb
- Party_char.amb

Offsets are given in hex. Sizes/lengths in dec. 16 and 32 bit values are stored in big endian format. So the most significant bytes come first. Example: The value 0x1234 is stored as 0x12 0x34 and the value 0x12345678 is stored as 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78.

ubyte means unsigned 8-bit value, uword means unsigned 16-bit value and ulong means unsigned 32-bit value.

Offset | Type | Description
----|----|----
0x0000 | ubyte | [Character type](Enumerations/CharacterTypes.md)
0x0001 | ubyte | [Gender](Enumerations/Gender.md)
0x0002 | ubyte | [Race](Enumerations/Races.md)
0x0003 | ubyte | [Class](Enumerations/Classes.md)
0x0004 | ubyte | [Usable spell types](Enumerations/SpellTypes.md)
0x0005 | ubyte | Level (1-50)
0x0006 | ubyte | Number of occupied hands (0-2, Alkem has 255 which might be a bug)
0x0007 | ubyte | Number of occupied fingers (0-2)
0x0008 | ubyte | [Spoken languages](Enumerations/Languages.md)
0x0009 | ubyte | Inventory inaccessible (0 means accessible, otherwise it's inaccessible)
0x000A | ubyte | Portrait index
0x000B | ubyte | Join percentage (0-100%). In Amberstar if you invite someone to your party this is the chance that he/she accepts. This is not used in Ambermoon.
0x000C | ubyte | Combat graphic index (only used for monsters)
0x000D | ubyte | Spell chance percentage (only used for monsters, not used in Ambermoon)
0x000E | ubyte | Magic bonus to hit (0-255, only used for monsters, not used in Ambermoon)
0x000F | ubyte | Monster morale, retreat percentage (0-100%), in **Ambermoon Advanced** this is used for party members as well to state if they exchanged experience already.
0x0010 | ubyte | Immunity to [spell types](Enumerations/SpellTypes.md)
0x0011 | ubyte | Attacks per round (APR)
0x0012 | ubyte | [Battle flags](Enumerations/BattleFlags.md) (monsters only in Ambermoon, party members as well in **Ambermoon Advanced**)
0x0013 | ubyte | [Elements and immunities](Enumerations/ElementsAndImmunities.md) (in original only used for monsters)
0x0014 | uword | Spell learning points (SLP)
0x0016 | uword | Training points (TP)
0x0018 | uword | Gold
0x001A | uword | Food
0x001C | uword | Character bit index. This bit is changed when a party member leaves the party or a conversation is left without taking the person with you. Initial this is set for Selena, Sabine and Valdyn. They will wait for you at different locations than when you first met them. Selena goes to the Sylph cave, Sabine and Valdyn go to Burnville. Gryban has an initial value of 0x0000. This is a bug. Gryban will vanish forever when he leaves the party or you won't take him with you. The correct value would be 0x35c0 or 0xffff. The value 0xffff means "not used" or "use initial location/use initial map character".
0x001E | uword | [Ailments](Enumerations/Ailments.md)

0x006A | uword | Current age
0x006C | uword | Max age
0x006E | uword[2] | Age bonus and backup values (like for other attributes). Always 0 in Ambermoon.
0x0072 | uword[4] | In Ambermoon there was also a 10th unused attribute. The current and max value is always 0. The bonus is 25 for Chris and 5 for Gryban. The last value is 0 as well. I guess this was a reserve and matches the amount of abilities. In **Ambermoon Advanced** this attribute is used for spell damage adjustment (see below).

## Attributes and abilities

Each attribute (including the character's age) and ability stores 4 values:
- Current value (without bonus)
- Max value (can be exceeded by current value + bonus and only limits the current value)
- Bonus value (granted by equipment etc)
- Backup value

The actual effective and also displayed value is the current value plus the bonus value.

The backup value stores the current value if a temporary effect is active which affects the current value. A good example is the exhaustion ailment. It cuts all attributes' current values in half. So the backup value will then store the current value before reduction and the new current value is cut in half. When the effect ends the backup value is assigned to the current value and therefore restores the old value.

## Level up

There is a value which determines when the number of attacks per round increases. It's called APRIncreaseLevels here.

The number of attacks per round is 1 if APRIncreaseLevels is 0. Otherwise it is `1 + floor(Level / APRIncreaseLevels)`.

Hit points and training points are increased on each level up by the given "per level" value. Spell points and spell learning points are increased by their "per level" value plus `floor(INT/25)`. Note that Ambermoon only uses the base INT value without bonus. This might be a bug. Spell points and spell learning points are only increased for magical classes which can have SP. So not for warriors, thieves or animals.

## Additional monster data

Monsters have additional data at offset 0x01E8.

Offset | Type | Description
----|----|----
0x01E8 | AnimationInfo[8] | Monster battle animations
0x02E8 | byte[8] | Used number of frames for each of the 8 animations (0-32)
0x02F0 | byte[16] | Atari palette (16 color indices)
0x0300 | byte[32] | Amiga palette (32 color indices)
0x0320 | ubyte | 1 bit for each animation (if set, the animation is played backwards after it has finished)
0x0321 | ubyte | Padding byte to get word alignment (always 0)
0x0322 | uword | Frame width (for graphic loading)
0x0324 | uword | Frame height (for graphic loading)
0x0326 | uword | Mapped frame width (for displaying)
0x0328 | uword | Mapped frame height (for displaying)

### Animation info

Each contains 32 bytes. Each byte gives a frame index (inside the monster graphic).

There is an animation info for 8 different actions:
- 0: Move (also used for the random idle animation, frame 0 of this is the monster idle frame!)
- 1: Short-range attack
- 2: Long-range attack
- 3: Cast spell
- 4: Hurt (receive damage)
- 5: Die
- 6: Start animation (like transformation of Nera, are played once at start)
- 7: Unknown3

## Monster groups

Monsters are grouped for fights. The file Monster_groups.amb contains all monster formations in the game. Each file consists of 18 uwords which represent the 18 tiles in combat where a monster can be placed starting at the upper-left and going line by line from left to right.

Each uword can contain a monster index starting at 1 (0 = no monster).

## Monster morale

A value of 100 will ensure that the monster will never flee. Therefore all bosses have a value of 100. The lower the value the higher the propability that the monster will flee.

Note that even with a morale lower than 100 the boss flag would avoid fleeing in any case.

There are 3 values in addition to the morale that influence the flee chance.

- RDE (relative damage efficiency)
- LLP (lost own LP)
- AC (ally count)

The RDE is a relation between average party damage and average monster group damage. It's influence can range from -12 to +12.

The LLP influence can range from 0 to +75 and therefore has the biggest impact.

The AC influence can range from -15 to +25.

If a random value from 0 to the sum of these 3 values is greater than the morale, the monster will try to flee.

## NPCs and party members

NPCs have no equipment nor inventory items (no data for it). After the name there is an event section (same format as map events).
Party members have a similar event section but behind inventory and equipment data. The hero has no events of course as you can't talk to him.

NPC conversations are implemented in the following way:

- There is an event list usually starting with a Conversation event.
- A conservation event just opens the conversation window without text.
- The text is added by the PrintText event.

There might be condition events which force jumps to different PrintText or Conversation events based on global variables and such things.

## Learned spells

Note that learned spells are stored a bit strange (with 1 bit offset). The lowest bit is always 0 (not used). Bit 1 is then used for spell 1, bit 2 for spell 2, etc. I guess the spell index 0 was also a valid value in the original (namely "no spell") and could theoretically be stored as bit 0.

## Bonus spell damage

In **Ambermoon Advanced** the 10th attribute grants bonus damage to spells of the 4 elements earth, wind, fire and water and for magic projectiles and ghost weapon or magic damage reduction. The "current value" specifies the base damage bonus which is applied in any case and the "max value" specifies the maximum damage bonus which only increases the possible maximum value. The 3rd value is a magic damage reduction value in percentage. The fourth value can specify a percentage value which is used for the total damage (0 means it is ignored). Note that the damage bonus values can also be negative and thus may represent a penalty.

- The total minimum damage is: spell's min damage + base bonus damage
- The total maximum damage is: spell's max damage + base bonus damage + maximum bonus damage

The fourth value is interpreted as a signed value in the range -32768 to +32767 and gives a percent value to add to the damage. A value of 0 would not change the damage, a value of 100 would increase the damage by 100% (so in total deals double damage). Every value smaller or equal -100 will set the damage to 0 but the logic will always use at least 1 point of damage.

Other bonusses like the elemental, level and intelligence bonus are applied afterwards so that the plain damage bonus given here increases the base damage range only.

For example if a level 40 monster has values 10 (base bonus) and 5 (max bonus) and casts the spell "Magic Projectile", the damage is as follows. Note that the spell does half the level as damage in general.

- Minimum damage is 20 + 10 = 30
- Maximum damage is 20 + 10 + 5 = 35

The third value (damage reduction) of the target is subtracted after the final damage calculation. It can reduce the damage down to 1. It is also a signed percentage value. So a value of 50 would reduce the received damage by 50%, while a value of -50% will even increase the received magic damage by 50%.
