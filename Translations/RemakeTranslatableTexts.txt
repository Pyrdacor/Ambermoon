## Tutorial texts

// Introduction
"Hi ~SELF~ and welcome to the Ambermoon Remake.^^Do you need a little introduction?",
// Tip 1
"The buttons in the lower right area of the screen provide many useful functions of " +
"the game. If you are on the main screen you can toggle the buttons by pressing the " +
"right mouse button while hovering the area or hitting the Return key. It will unlock " +
"additional functions.",
// Tip 2
"You can also use the NumPad on your keyboard to control those buttons. The layout " +
"is exactly as the in-game buttons. So hitting the key 7 will be equivalent to pressing " +
"the upper left button (the eye).",
// Tip 3
"In the upper area you see the character portraits. You can click on them to select the " +
"active player or right click them to open the inventories. The keyboard keys 1-6 will select " +
"a player as well and keys F1-F6 will open the inventories.",
// Tip 4
"You can move on maps by using the mouse, keys W, A, S, D or the cursor keys. In 2D you can " +
"right click on the map to change the cursor into an action cursor to interact with objects " +
"or characters like NPCs.",
// End
"Now I'm quiet. Have fun playing Ambermoon!"
