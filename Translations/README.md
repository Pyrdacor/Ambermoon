## Translation

Download the following files:

- [EnglishExtroTextGroups.zip](EnglishExtroTextGroups.zip)
- [IntroTexts.zip](IntroTexts.zip)
- [RemakeTranslatableTexts.txt](RemakeTranslatableTexts.txt)

Translate all the texts. Best use UTF-8 when opening and storing text files so all characters will be correct on different machines with different default locales.

Inside the RemakeTranslatableTexts only translate texts inside quotes. Like "Some Text". Don't change other texts in the file!

Always keep things like \~HERO~, \~SELF~, \~INK17~ and so on as they are. Those are placeholders. The same is true for the character '^' which is a newline and '$' which is a non-breaking space. Don't add newlines directly.

Things like {0} are also placeolders. Keep them as there will be values inserted in their place.

RemakeTranslatableTexts.txt contains some hints as well inside the text file for additional guidance.



Inside the extro texts there might be texts starting with '\_' or '$'. Keep those markers. '\_' denotes that the text uses the large font while '$' and '$$' mark the translator name of the english version. It will be replaced with your name later. You can add your name their but keep the dollar signs in front of it.
