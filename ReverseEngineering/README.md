# Ambermoon Reverse Engineering

I use [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) with the [hunk loader plugin](https://github.com/lab313ru/ghidra_amiga_ldr) to reverse engineer the original Ambermoon sources.

The current state is provided as a ghidra zip file (*.gzp) which can be integrate into a ghidra project. It contains the ASM source, custom type definitions and labels like function or data names.

At the end this should become well-documented ASM code which can be used to re-compile Ambermoon.

Base is the deploded AM2_CPU version of original 1.07 english.
