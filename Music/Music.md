Here you can find all SonicArranger files of the Ambermoon soundtrack.

Files without an extension are the export format which contains the code for the replayer. This is the format used in Ambermoon and can't be opened by SonicArranger.

Files with the .sa extension are the SonicArranger module files. They can be read by SonicArranger, so you can edit them.

**Note** that I converted the export files back to the module files with my own tools. The export format lacks a few information that the module format has, so they won't be binary identical to the originals. But those information are just meta information like sample names, currently selected pattern and so on. So they represent 100% of the original song data.

There are 34 SonicArranger files in Ambermoon:

- 32 ingame songs stored in Music.amb
- One intro music file stored in Intro_music
- One outro music file stored in Extro_music

Note that the song which is played while seeing the main screen (Lyramion in the background) before the game starts, is also present in the intro music file. It contains two songs. The one for the intro and the one for the main screen.

Some ingame songs also have additional songs stored. Those are alternative versions of the songs but I guess none of them is really used in Ambermoon.
